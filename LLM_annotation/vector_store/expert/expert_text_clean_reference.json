Reiche Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen 5232, Switzerland (Received 18 February 2016; published 25 May 2016)  \n Several beam manipulation methods have been studied and experimentally tested to generate two-color photon beams in free electron laser facilities to accommodate the user requests. We propose to use the interaction of the beam with an oscillating longitudinal wakefield source to obtain a suitable electron beam structure. The bunch generates two subpulses with different energies and delayed in time passing through a magnetic chicane after its longitudinal phase space has been modulated by the wakefield source. According to this approach the power of the emitted radiation is not degraded compared to the monochromatic beam, and the setup in the machine is quite simple because the bunch is manipulated only in the high energy section, where it is more rigid. We present the design applied to SwissFEL. We identified the parameters and the corresponding range of tunability of the time and energy separation among the two subbunches.  \n DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.19.050702  \n I. INTRODUCTION  \n Free electron laser (FEL) facilities are the highest brightness sources used for scientific applications, opening up atomic imaging at femtosecond down to attosecond time resolution. Several FELs are in operation and their success has triggered the development of more facilities around the world. On the way, the success of this kind of machines new operation modes are studied to accommodate the different user requests. One of the modes is the so-called two-color scheme, where two pulses with different photon energy and adjustable time separation are generated. The dynamics of ultrafast processes can be studied using a highintensity X-ray pump and probe to reach time resolution at the level of a few femtoseconds. This technique has already been successfully applied to numerically study warm dense matter [1,2] as well as multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion imaging [3] using serial femtosecond crystallography [4].  \n The wavelength of the radiation emitted in a FEL, $\\lambda _ { R }$ , may be expressed as a function of the $K$ parameter of the undulators as [5]:  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { R } = \\frac { \\lambda _ { U } } { 2 \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\left( 1 + \\frac { K ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \\right) ,\n$$ \n where $\\lambda _ { U }$ is the undulator period, and $\\gamma$ the beam Lorentz factor.  \n The first technique used to generate the two colors is based on the dependence of the radiation wavelength on the undulator field parameter. The two colors are generated using distinct values of $K$ with a quasi monoenergetic electron beam [6,7]. This method has been proved experimentally at the Linac coherent light source (LCLS). The main advantages of this technique are the large tunability of the time delay (from 0 ps up to few hundreds of fs), the energy separation (up to few tens of percent), and the synchronization of the two photon pulses, albeit the total power is typically strongly reduced (about $1 / 1 0$ of the full saturation power for the LCLS case [6]).  \n Another scheme, called twin-bunch approach, has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated at optical wavelengths [8] and in the range of $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -rays [9]. This method makes use of the pulse-stacking technique, used in several photo-injectors to obtain a longitudinal flat laser profile [10,11]. Besides generating two-color FELs, the twinbunch scheme can also find application in beam or wakefield driven plasma acceleration. Compared with the masking technique adopted now [12], this method gives more flexibility in the control of the charge distribution, peak current, and time delay among the two pulses.  \n In contrast to the previous approach based on distinct values of $K$ , in the twin-bunch scheme each subpulse of the electron beam efficiently participates to the lasing process, producing a larger X-ray power, albeit the tunability of the time and energy separation of the two-pulses is limited and the setup of the machine requires a longer procedure compared to the $K$ method. In this case the time and the energy separation among the two subpulses is smaller than in the previous method, and they are not independent. A discussion about how to control these quantities in the twinbunch approach has been presented in [13]. Some knobs have been identified to be used alone or in combination to vary the time and the energy separation of the subpulses, but some correlation among these two quantities is still present and a current variation of the subpulses has to be tolerated. The latter limitation arises from the fact that the beam dynamics is very different for the two subpulses mode and the nominal operation setup. Consequently in the twin-bunch mode the machine has to be tuned in the low energy section (energy smaller than about $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { M e V } ,$ .  \n  \n We propose to generate two electron pulses separated in time and energy using the interaction of a longitudinal wakefield excited by the beam passing through a dielectriclined or a corrugated waveguide. In the last years several possibilities have been considered to manipulate a relativistic bunch using its interaction with the wakefield excited by the beam passing through this kind of structure. They include the possibility to control the energy chirp [14,15], linearize the longitudinal phase space beam distribution residual from the bunch compression process [16,17], drive coherent terahertz radiation [18,19], and do longitudinal diagnostics [20]. We propose to use the longitudinal wakefield to super-impose to the global chirp (obtained by going-off-crest in the rf structures) modulations at two locations along the beam longitudinal phase space. Properly choosing the wavelength of the wakefield we can generate energy chirps of opposite sign along different intervals of the longitudinal coordinate of the beam. The bunch with such a modulation passing through a magnetic chicane is then compressed, generating the two-color modes. In this case the low energy section of the machine is not modified compared to the nominal setup, and by this our proposed approach eases the setup compared to the twin-bunch scheme. Some knobs have been identified to control the time and energy separation of the two subpulses in [13], accepting a variation of the peak current of the subpulses and some dependence of the time delay on the energy separation. In our scheme we could in principle use the same knobs since the beam structure at the exit of the low energy section is similar to the one of the twin-bunches case. We also identified two knobs to independently control the time and energy separation of the two subpulses and at the same time keeping constant the peak currents of the two subpulses.  \n Other methods have been studied and experimentally tested to generate subpulses separated in time and energy using the hardware dedicated to the seeding schemes.  \n Different wavelengths of the seeding laser have been used [21,22], or the crystal used in the self-seeding scheme has been oriented to allow for two reflections, producing different wavelengths in the transmitted X-ray pulses [23].  \n We applied and optimized our method to SwissFEL, the FEL facility briefly described in Sec. II. We will present the scheme in Sec. III, identifying a suitable source of the wakefield in terms of wavelength and amplitude (subsection III A), and we will show a possible geometry (subsection III B). Finally we will discuss the tunability of time delay and energy separation among the subpulses (subsection III C).  \n II. THE SwissFEL FREE ELECTRON LASER FACILITY  \n SwissFEL [24] is the FEL facility under construction at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Its hard and soft $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray beam lines, Athos and Aramis, will produce photon pulses with wavelengths ranging from 0.1 to $0 . 7 { \\mathrm { n m } }$ , and from 0.7 to $7 \\mathrm { n m }$ , respectively. The commissioning of the accelerator is foreseen to start in fall 2016 and the first pilot user experiments are expected before the end of 2017. The schematic layout of the machine is shown in Fig. 1. The electron beam emitted from a cesium-telluride photocathode illuminated by a UV-laser will be accelerated up to $1 5 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ by two S-band cavities, preceding a laser heater system used to mitigate the microbunching instability [25]. The beam energy will then be boosted to $3 3 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ by other S-band cavities, before the bunch will be compressed in the first bunch compressor (BC1). The beam will then be accelerated to $2 . 1 \\mathrm { \\ G e V }$ by C-band cavities before being compressed further in the second bunch compressor (BC2) to reach the short bunch lengths necessary for the lasing in the X-ray region. The most relevant parameters for the two compression stages at SwissFEL are listed in Table I for the maximum bunch charges foreseen.  \n The S-band cavities between the laser heater and BC1 and the C-band structures between the two bunch compressors will be run at off-crest phase to generate the energy-time correlation for the compression with a phase $\\phi _ { 1 }$ and $\\phi _ { 2 }$ , respectively. The C-band cavities downstream of BC2 will be run on-crest in normal operation at phase $\\phi _ { 3 }$ , since these cavities are mainly used to increase the beam energy up to $5 . 8 \\mathrm { G e V }$ at the entrance of the Aramis line and their longitudinal wakefield will reduce the residual relative energy chirp from the compression process cumulated in the previous stages.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I. Beam parameters at the BC1 and BC2 exit, and at the entrance of the Aramis undulator line in SwissFEL.

LONGITUDINAL PHASE SPACE MANIPULATION  \n In the previous schemes used to generate the two-color operation mode the beam/radiation properties were modified at the end of the machine in the undulator lines [6] or at the location of the electrons emission from the photocathode [9]. These methods present both advantages and drawbacks. The first approach provides full control of the time and energy separation of the two subpulses, but implies a reduction of the total emitted power with respect to the case of the quasi monoenergetic configuration. The twin-bunch scheme overcomes this limitation, but it introduces other issues, such as the difficulty in the setup, and a study has shown that there is a correlation between the time and the energy separation of the sub-bunches [13].  \n We propose to modulate the beam longitudinal phase space upstream of BC1 using the longitudinal oscillating wakefield excited by the bunch itself passing through an opportune device, and to use the same compressor to generate the current peaks. In this case each current peak lases independently and reaches saturation generating the maximum FEL power, as for the twin-bunch scheme. On top of this, the bunch is not modified in the low energy section of the machine, so that no degradation is expected and the setup is easier than in the case of the twin-bunches case. Since the beam longitudinal phase space structure obtained with our method is very similar to the twin-bunch configuration, we could in principle use the knobs identified in [13] to tune the time and energy separation of the subpulses, accepting a reasonable peak current variation. To these knobs we preferred to use the tunable wavelength of the wakefield and the phase $\\phi _ { 3 }$ . These parameters allows to independently control the time and the energy separation of the two subpulses keeping a constant value of the peak currents. A detailed description of the tunability of the system will be given in Sec. III C.  \n Our scheme requires an oscillating wakefield source with a characteristic wavelength $\\lambda _ { W }$ , which satisfies the condition:  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { W } \\approx L _ { z } / 2 ,\n$$ \n where $L _ { z }$ is the full bunch length of the uncompressed beam. In this way we can generate chirps with different signs along the longitudinal coordinate of the bunch, s. As an example Fig. 2 shows the comparison between the SwissFEL nominal $2 0 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ charge beam longitudinal phase space and that corresponding to a bunch passing through a wakefield source satisfying the condition in Eq. (2). A chirp is applied as in the nominal operation mode by going offcrest in the structures upstream of BC1 and on top of that the sinusoidal wake potential is used to generate the two chirps. Such a beam passing through BC1 will produce the two current peaks along the bunch.  \n By changing the ratio of $\\lambda _ { W }$ over $L _ { z }$ the two-color scheme may easily become a setup for a multicolor operation mode, with a limited tunability compared to the two-color case (time and energy separation may not be changed individually for the subpulses).  \n A. Longitudinal wakefield source  \n Several longitudinal wakefield sources are suitable to generate a pattern as the one shown in Fig. 2. Among the different possibilities we consider the cases of a corrugated plate and a dielectric tube, because of their large wakefield amplitude (typically of the order of $1 0 ^ { 1 6 } – 1 0 ^ { 1 8 } \\ \\mathrm { V / C / m } )$ . and the wavelength range (from hundreds of microns to millimeters assuming reasonable geometries from a manufacturing point of view). In the case of the corrugated plate an adjustable gap may be used to tune the wakefield amplitude and wavelength, albeit the strength is reduced by a geometrical factor of $\\pi ^ { 2 } / 1 6$ compared to the cylindrical case assuming the same aperture [26]. The intensity of the wakefield of a corrugated plate is enough to shape the beam longitudinal phase space assuming a reasonable length (below $2 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ ) considering the SwissFEL beam energy and $R _ { 5 6 }$ at the first compressor. We therefore chose the planar geometry, because of its better flexibility to control the wavelength in despite of the smaller intensity of the wakefield compared to the cylindrical case. The optimization procedure and the considerations are general, and therefore valid also for other wakefield sources characterized by the same wavelength and strength.  \n  \n Figure 3 shows the schematic layout of a corrugated plate.  \n The longitudinal point-charge wake function, $w ( s )$ , is given by [27]:  \n $$\nw \\bigl ( s \\bigr ) \\sim \\frac { \\pi } { 1 6 } \\frac { Z _ { 0 } c } { \\pi a ^ { 2 } } H \\bigl ( s \\bigr ) \\cos \\mathopen { } \\mathclose \\bgroup \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi } { \\lambda _ { W } } s \\aftergroup \\egroup \\right) ,\n$$ \n where $Z _ { 0 }$ and $c$ are the free space impedance and the vacuum speed of light, respectively, and $H ( s )$ is the unit step function. The other parameters depend on the geometry of the corrugation and the semiaperture $a$ . The expression in Eq. (3) is valid only under the following assumptions with reference to Fig. 3: (i) $\\delta$ and $p \\ll a$ , (ii) $\\delta \\geq p$ . If these conditions are satisfied the wake potential has a sinusoidal dependence on $s$ with wavelength given by:  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { W } = 2 \\pi \\sqrt { \\frac { a \\delta g } { 2 p } } .\n$$ \n We see that the wavelength of the wake potential depends on the geometry of the plate and the semigap, whereas the  \n amplitude is only a function of $a$ . We used these considerations to dimension our system for SwissFEL.  \n B. Application to SwissFEL  \n The optimal location to install the corrugated plate is upstream of the first bunch compressor to maximize the relative energy chirp and minimize the impact on the machine at lower energies compared to the nominal setup. At SwissFEL there is $8 \\mathrm { m }$ of available space where the corrugated plate may be accommodated between the last S-band structure and the entrance of BC1. The most important beam parameters at this location are shown in Table II.  \n We optimized the geometry and the length of the corrugated plate using the numerical codes Elegant [28] and LiTrack [29]. The first code determines the particles distribution at any position along the accelerator applying matrix transformations to the initial beam 6D phase-space. It convolutes the wake function with the beam distribution, and computes space charge forces, albeit only along the longitudinal dimension. LiTrack is a faster code, which includes the longitudinal dynamics neglecting any space charge force both in the transverse and in the longitudinal dimension. Considering the relatively low beam charge density and high energy at the location where the plate may be installed we used the latter code to perform all the optimizations, as the space charge forces are negligible. We verified with Elegant the tracking of some reference cases and we used these distributions to obtain information on the power of the emitted radiation using Genesis [30]. We assumed a minimum semiaperture of the plate, $a$ , of $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . Since the transverse rms beam size at the location where the corrugated plate may be installed is smaller than $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ (see Table II), this seemed to be a conservative assumption.  \n The induced relative energy chirp is proportional to the length of the corrugated plate, $L _ { P }$ , and the inverse of the square of the semiaperture $a$ , therefore any combination of these quantities keeping constant the ratio $L _ { P } / a ^ { 2 }$ is equivalent from the beam dynamics point of view. We tuned the length of the corrugated plate to have a factor 3 between the saturation length at the slices along the beam corresponding to the current peaks and those at the low current regions assuming $a$ equal to $2 \\mathrm { m m }$ . In this way we have some margin to reduce $a$ going towards smaller $\\lambda _ { W }$ , while keeping $L _ { P }$ below $2 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ . Figure 4 shows the power along the electron beam longitudinal coordinate and the spectrum of the emitted radiation at the end of the Aramis line simulated using Genesis for cases corresponding to different time delays and energy separations of the subpulses. As it can be seen in the top plot of Fig. 4 the radiation power generated by the slices of the beam corresponding to the current spikes is much larger than that produced by the slices in between the spikes.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE II.

(4) the wavelength of the wakefield is function of only the three geometrical parameters $p , g$ and $\\delta$ and the semiaperture of the plate $a$ . A variation of any of them is equivalent to a change of one of the others from the beam dynamics point of view. Figure 5 shows the dependence of $\\lambda _ { W }$ on $a$ and $\\delta$ assuming a $g$ over $p$ ratio equal to $1 / 3$ . We selected the geometries characterized by a $g / p = 1 / 3$ , as this is a good compromise between the simplicity of the manufacture and the range of the achievable wavelengths. We finally selected the values of $g$ and $p$ to satisfy the conditions of validity of the wakefield expression in Eq. (3). The parameters chosen for our design are summarized in Table III. This is only one of the possible geometries, chosen in our case more or less arbitrarily from manufacturing considerations. In the following discussion we will consider this case as the reference geometry and we will indicate its parameters with the 0 subscript.  \n  \n To have an idea of the orbit jitter tolerance, we computed the centroid position along the bunch assuming different beam-structure offsets. A $5 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ transverse offset at the corrugated plate translates to a difference of the centroid position of the slices corresponding to the peak currents of about $3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ rms, which gives less than $10 \\%$ energy degradation. This is an overestimation of the beam degradation, because we consider the case that all the slices lasing have the maximum offset of the centroid position. The expected maximum orbit jitter at the location of the corrugated plate is smaller than $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm m$ $1 / 1 0$ of the rms size of the beam at that location), so this does not seem to be critical for the system.  \n In the simulations we neglected the quadrupolar component of the wakefield. This will give a focusing along the different slices of the bunch. We consider this to be compensated by using an even number of modules, as done at LCLS for parameters more critical than ours (longer structures and smaller semigap with double beam energy) [31].  \n Table: Caption: TABLE III.

Tunability  \n An important request for the two-color operation mode is the possibility of tuning independently the time delay and the energy separation among the subpulses. In the case of the twin-bunch scheme several quantities have been identified to modify the time and the energy separation [13]. According to this scheme the time delay among the two bunches may be increased by reducing the beam energy at the second bunch compressor, increasing the amplitude of the wakes acting on the bunch, the beam charge, the value of $R _ { 5 6 }$ of the second bunch compressor, or changing simultaneously the phases of the cavities upstream the first bunch compressor and in between the two compressors. Since the beam longitudinal phase space distribution obtained applying our scheme is quite similar to the twin-bunch case, the same knobs are expected to be usable for the tuning of the device. Figure 6 shows as an example the time and the energy separation among the two subpulses at the entrance of the Aramis undulator line as a function of the phases $\\phi _ { 1 }$ and $\\phi _ { 2 }$ . Similarly to the twinbunch scheme, the time and the energy separation may be controlled almost independently by appropriately tuning one knob at a time or a combination of them, but a certain variation of the peak currents has to be accepted (in the case corresponding to Fig. 6 the current peaks are between $2 \\mathrm { k A }$ and $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { k A } ^ { \\cdot }$ ). As already shown in [13] if the peak current is constrained in a certain range there is a correlation between the time and energy separation between the subpulses for configurations with large time delay and large energy separation.  \n  \n In our scheme we may use the dependence of $\\lambda _ { W }$ on $a$ [see Eq. (4)] to vary the time delay among the subpulses. According to Eq. (3) the amplitude of the wakefield depends on the semiaperture of the corrugated structure, therefore for each value of $a$ there is a unique length of the device which produces the same effect on the beam. This length can be expressed as:  \n $$\nL _ { P } ( \\lambda _ { W } ) = \\frac { L _ { 0 } } { a _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } k _ { g } ^ { 4 } } \\lambda _ { W } ^ { 4 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\lambda _ { W }$ is a generic wavelength of the wakefield, which may be written as:  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { W } = k _ { g } \\sqrt { a } ,\n$$ \n the 0 subscript corresponds to the reference geometry $\\dot { a } _ { 0 } = 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and $L _ { 0 } = 1 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ , and $k _ { g }$ depends on the geometry:  \n $$\nk _ { g } = 2 \\pi \\sqrt { \\frac { \\delta g } { 2 p } } .\n$$ \n corrugated plate. If the length of the device is chosen as shown in Fig. 7 the peak current of the sub-bunches is the same as for the case corresponding to our reference geometry without changing any other knob in the machine.  \n The beam passing through a corrugated plate excites not only the dipolar mode considered until here, but also a quadrupolar component because of the broken symmetry of the system around the beam axis. Pairs of corrugated plates rotated by 90 degrees are normally used to compensate for this effect [31]. Corrugated plates of different lengths may be used to discretely compensate for the wakefield amplitude variation with $a$ , as schematically shown in Fig. 8. In this way passing with an off-axis trajectory or equivalently moving the plates transversally to the beam longitudinal trajectory may be possible to control the length of the corrugated plate experienced by the beam.  \n Another possible way to vary the wavelength without affecting the amplitude of the wakefield is to modulate the plate putting a depth of corrugation changing along the transverse dimension. In this way, shifting the structure or the beam orbit, the distance of the subpulses may be modified keeping constant the peak current.  \n The possibility of changing the length of the corrugated plate adds flexibility to our system. In case we chose the length of the device for each value of $a$ equal to the length $L _ { P }$ we may reduce the time separation among the subpulses by closing the gap of the corrugated plate. On the contrary we may increase the time separation among the pulses closing the gap of the device using a length of the device larger than $L _ { P }$ . In this case, in fact, we have to reduce the global chirp generated by the rf structures to keep a constant peak current of the subpulses, and, by this, we put away the subpulses in time. As an example Fig. 9 shows the current profile obtained assuming $a$ of $1 \\mathrm { m m }$ and a plate length of $1 \\mathrm { m }$ , instead of about $0 . 4 \\mathrm { m }$ corresponding to the $L _ { P }$ computed from Eq. (5) for this semigap. In this case we can increase the time separation by $50 \\%$ compared to the reference configuration. Furthermore if we prevent the central part of the bunch from lasing, for example using a foil in a dispersive section to degrade the emittance only in the central section of the beam in the longitudinal dimension [32], we could further double the time separation among the subpulses, using the first and the last subpulse. In this case we can reach a time separation among the pulses of about 370 fs. This configuration may also be used to obtain a three-color operation mode.  \n  \n We identified $\\phi _ { 3 }$ as the knob we may use to modify the energy separation among the subpulses without changing the current peak of the sub-bunches. In nominal operation these cavities will be run on-crest to boost the beam energy from 2.1 to $5 . 8 \\ \\mathrm { G e V }$ and their wakefields will be used to compensate the residual energy chirp from the compression process. In the best scenario, i.e., in the range of $\\phi _ { 3 }$ between $- 9 0$ and $+ 9 0$ degrees with respect to the on-crest phase, we expect that the energy separation among the two subpulses, $\\Delta E$ , ranges from $0 . 6 \\%$ to $1 . 5 \\%$ . Limiting the variation of $\\phi _ { 3 }$ to $\\pm 6 0$ degrees, which corresponds to the maximum beam energy variation we can compensate increasing the amplitude of the cavities downstream of BC2, we expect $\\Delta E$ to be from about $0 . 6 \\%$ up to more than $1 . 1 \\%$ . Considering that $R _ { 5 6 }$ downstream of BC2 is zero, the current peaks of the sub-bunches are the same as for the reference geometry configuration in all the cases.  \n Table IV summarizes the ranges of the time and energy separation expected for the SwissFEL case keeping the same peak current of both subpulses. In Table IV we report the cases where the global chirp introduced going off-crest in the rf structures corresponds to the under compression layout (positive). In this configuration the high energy subpulse arrives before the low energy one. Setting the phases of the rf cavities to reverse the sign of the chirp (over  \n TABLE IV.

The rotation of the global chirp may be also used to further reduce the time separation among the sub-pulses, accepting a smaller ratio of the current at the peaks and in between the maxima.  \n With the scheme we propose we can provide $3 \\mathrm { k A }$ peak current two sub-bunches with a time delay tunable from 85 fs up to about 380 fs and an energy separation between about $0 . 6 \\%$ and more than $1 \\%$ assuming the constraint we have on the maximum energy gain in the last SwissFEL cavities. If we let the peak current of the subpulses to vary in a range of some kA we can further enlarge the time and the energy separation equivalent to how it is done in the twin-bunch configuration.  \n We optimized the geometry of the corrugated plates and its aperture to have these energy and time separations among the subpulses. Smaller or larger separations for the reference geometry may be obtained modifying the corrugation of the device.  \n IV. CONCLUSIONS  \n We have presented a scheme based on wakefield generation to obtain a two-color operation mode in FEL facilities. We have shown that we can generate two subbunches independently tunable in time and separated in energy keeping constant the peak current. Compared to previous methods our approach does not degrade the lasing power, because the bunches lase individually to saturation, and does not significantly modify the machine settings in the low energy section, so that its implementation in the accelerator is simplified compared to the twin-bunches scheme. By changing the ratio of the wavelength of the wakefield source and the initial beam length this scheme may also produce multicolor bunches, also if with more limited tunability in time and energy. The same scheme could in principle be applied to any FEL or in the framework of plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA).  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n We would like to acknowledge T. Schietinger, H. H.

We experimentally investigate such screening by measuring the effect of dielectric wakefields driven by the bunch in a uncoated dielectric capillary where the plasma is confined. We show that the plasma screens the space-charge field and therefore suppresses the dielectric wakefields when the distance between the bunch and the dielectric surface is much larger than the plasma skin depth. Before full screening is reached, the effects of dielectric and plasma wakefields are present simultaneously.  \n DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.035001  \n Introduction.—One of the fundamental properties of plasma is the ability to screen electromagnetic fields, due to the presence of mobile charge carriers (plasma electrons and ions) [1]. The propagation of electromagnetic waves in plasma has been extensively studied [2], especially in the context of plasma generation [3], heating, and confinement [4], requiring complex and dedicated experimental setups [5]. In the case of a relativistic charged particle bunch traveling through a plasma with density $n _ { P E }$ , the plasma electrons rapidly move to compensate for the almost purely transverse space-charge field of the bunch. This effect is the cause of phenomena such as plasma wakefields [6,7].  \n Because of the screening operated by the plasma, the space-charge field of the bunch is exponentially damped with the radial distance $r$ as $E _ { r } \\propto e ^ { - r / \\delta }$ [8], where the characteristic length $\\delta = c \\sqrt { m _ { e } \\varepsilon _ { 0 } / n _ { P E } e ^ { 2 } }$ is the plasma skin depth ( $\\scriptstyle { \\dot { c } }$ the speed of light, $\\varepsilon _ { 0 }$ the vacuum permittivity, $m _ { e }$ and $e$ the electron rest mass and charge, respectively). Hence, the plasma effectively screens the space-charge field of the bunch when $r \\gg \\delta$ . Despite the physics of the process being well known, no direct experimental evidence of plasma screening has been provided so far for the fields generated by a relativistic charged particle bunch.  \n In this Letter, we present a noninvasive measurement of plasma screening of the space-charge field of a relativistic electron bunch. We show that screening causes the suppression of dielectric wakefields in an uncoated dielectric capillary, where the plasma is generated, when the distance between the bunch and the capillary surface is much larger than the plasma skin depth. Moreover we observe, for the first time to our knowledge, the simultaneous effect of dielectric and plasma wakefields, when full plasma screening is not achieved.  \n  \n A relativistic, charged bunch drives wakefields when its space-charge field interacts with a slow-wave structure or medium with a large index of refraction. Consequently, longitudinal and transverse dielectric wakefields (also known as Cherenkov wakefields) are generated [9–12]. Dielectric transverse wakefields are axis symmetric with respect to the center of the dielectric structure. Therefore, they induce a dipolar effect when the bunch trajectory is not aligned to the longitudinal axis of the structure [13–18]. The transverse wake potential is calculated as the convolution of the transverse wake function $w$ (depending on the geometry, the dielectric material and the bunch transverse offset with respect to the center of the structure) with the longitudinal charge density distribution of the bunch $n _ { b } ( t )$ .  \n Thus, when a bunch travels with transverse offset $( x , y )$ , parallel to its axis, it drives transverse dipolar wakefields along the bunch described by [16]: $\\begin{array} { r } { W _ { \\perp } ( t ) = w ( x , y ) \\int _ { 0 } ^ { t } n _ { b } ( t ) d t } \\end{array}$ , where the bunch front is at $t = 0$ . The amplitude of the wakefields follows the same trend as the running integral of the bunch charge: particles in the back of the bunch are deflected more strongly than those in the front. The polarity of $W _ { \\perp }$ is such that the trailing particles are pulled further toward the dielectric material [19].  \n Dielectric capillaries are common tools for generating plasmas in plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA), as they enable gas injection in a high-vacuum environment [20]. The plasma is generated by ionizing the gas injected in the capillary with a high-voltage discharge applied between electrodes at each end [21], or with an ionization field such as a high-intensity laser pulse [22] or a relativistic charged particle bunch [23]. Capillaries are also employed because they allow shaping the transverse and longitudinal profiles of the plasma density [24], and locally injecting different gas species for various injection schemes [25].  \n  \n In a PWFA based on dielectric capillaries, both plasma and dielectric wakefields can be present at the same time, as the space-charge electric field of the driver bunch may interact with both plasma and dielectric material [26,27]. In particular, the possible misalignment of the trajectory with respect to the capillary longitudinal axis (e.g., due to jitters or to the finite accuracy of the alignment tools) may induce a deflection to the bunch trajectory. This could have detrimental effects on the propagation of the bunches and the acceleration quality, by inducing transverse phenomena such as beam breakup and hosing instability [28,29]. However, we show in the present work that high-density plasma suppresses the dielectric wakefields driven in the capillary, by screening the space-charge field of the bunch.  \n Experimental setup.—We performed the measurements at the SPARC_LAB facility [30] (see Fig. 1). An electron $( e ^ { - } )$ bunch is generated by illuminating a copper cathode within a radiofrequency (RF) gun with an ultraviolet laser pulse. The bunch is accelerated in an RF linac to $E \\sim 8 0 ~ \\mathrm { M e V }$ and focused with transverse root mean square (rms) radius ${ \\sim } 0 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ at the entrance of a dielectric capillary. A set of electromagnetic quadrupoles focuses the bunch on a scintillating screen $d = 5 . 3 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ downstream of the capillary exit for imaging. A transverse deflection structure (TDS) introduces a head-to-tail vertical correlation to the bunch [31], allowing one to obtain time-resolved images of the bunch at the screen position. The normalized emittance of the bunch is ${ \\sim } 2 . 4 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (measured with quadrupole scan technique) and rms duration ${ \\sim } 1 . 8$ ps. We use a magnetic dipole and an additional scintillating screen to measure the beam energy.  \n The dielectric capillary has radius $R _ { c } = 1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and length $L = 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ . The plasma is generated by a discharge pulse ${ \\sim } 4 5 5$ A peak current) flowing through the capillary after the introduction of hydrogen gas ${ \\sim } 1 0$ mbar) through a high-speed solenoid valve. The capillary is installed in a vacuum chamber connected to the linac with a windowless, three-stage differential pumping system. The latter ensures that $1 0 ^ { - 8 }$ mbar is maintained in the linac, while flowing the gas, and to preserve the quality of the electron bunch. By varying the delay between the bunch arrival time and the peak of the discharge pulse we vary $n _ { P E }$ , due to recombination of the plasma. We measure the average $n _ { P E }$ with the Stark broadening technique [32] between 0.65 and $2 . 6 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ after the peak of the discharge pulse, and we extrapolate the values of $n _ { P E }$ (with ${ \\sim } 1 0 \\%$ uncertainty) at the delays used in the experiment (between 5.60 and $1 0 . 1 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s } ^ { \\prime }$ ) by fitting the measured values with an exponential decay function [33]. The plasma electron density is essentially constant along the capillary (see Supplemental Material [34]), but nonuniformities are present at the two extremes because the gas flow expands in the vacuum chamber. However, as no capillary material is present, there is also no dielectric wakefield effect along the entrance and exit ramps. Thus, in the following we neglect these nonuniformities.  \n  \n Current discharge is particularly suited for generating plasma in our experimental conditions because the moderate energy and current of the $e ^ { - }$ bunch are not sufficient to field ionize hydrogen gas. Moreover, it is preferable over ionization with a laser pulse because it generates an almost uniform transverse plasma density profile, and it requires simpler synchronization and spatial alignment methods.  \n In the following, we maintain the beam trajectory aligned through the center of the quadrupole magnets, and we record images on the screen with the TDS turned on, and the dipole turned off. To study the effect of dielectric wakefields and plasma screening, we shift the capillary with a stepper motor in the horizontal direction (perpendicular to the streaking direction of the TDS, see Supplemental Material [34]), and we measure the induced deflection along the bunch on timeresolved images while varying the plasma electron density and, therefore, the plasma skin depth.  \n Experimental results.—Figure 2 shows single-event, time-resolved images of a $2 8 5 ~ \\mathsf { p C } ~ e ^ { - }$ bunch after traveling along the longitudinal axis of the dielectric capillary (a), and with a horizontal offset $X = 0 . 3 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (b). The bunch propagates from right to left (bunch front at $t = 0$ ). The red points show the centroid position along the bunch, obtained by fitting the transverse projection of each longitudinal slice with a Gaussian function. In the aligned case, the centroid position is essentially constant along the bunch, and the variations are much smaller than the bunch transverse size. The average centroid position obtained from 100 consecutive images (red points, left-hand-side vertical axis in Fig. 2(c); the error bars represent the standard deviation) is not correlated with the running sum of the bunch charge (black line, right-hand-side vertical axis; the shaded area is the standard deviation) because $w ( 0 , 0 ) = 0$ .  \n In the misaligned case [Fig. 2(b)], on the contrary, the centroid is clearly deflected, with increasing displacement along the bunch. Figure 2(d) shows that the centroid position and the running sum follow the same trend along the bunch. This confirms the expectation that the amplitude of the transverse wakefields (and therefore of the transverse deflection) at any time $t$ along the bunch depends on the amount of charge ahead of it, in agreement with the formulation of $W _ { \\perp } ( t )$ .  \n  \n The amplitude of the transverse wakefields $W _ { \\perp }$ reaches a maximum at the back of the bunch. We calculate the average wakefield potential experienced by the particles in the last slice of the bunch $( t \\sim 6 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { p s } )$ as $\\bar { W } _ { \\perp } = x ( t ) E / e d L \\sim 0 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { M V / m }$ . We also note that, in both cases, the transverse size slightly increases along the bunch. This is due to the fact that the dielectric wakefields also have a quadrupolar (defocusing) component, growing in amplitude along the bunch.  \n When introducing plasma with $n _ { P E } = 1 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 6 } ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ while $X = 0 . 3 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ [Fig. 3(a), same misalignment as Fig. 2(b)], the dielectric wakefields are suppressed because the plasma effectively screens the space-charge field of the bunch, since the plasma skin depth $\\delta = 0 . 0 5 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ is much shorter than the distance between the bunch and the dielectric surface $R _ { c } - X = 0 . 6 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . Thus, the average position of the centroid along the bunch [green points in (c)] is in agreement with the aligned case with no plasma in the capillary [blue points, same dataset as Fig. 2(c)].  \n Slices at $t > 3$ ps have a wider transverse distribution because the bunch also drives plasma wakefields, that are axis symmetric with respect to the bunch propagation axis.  \n Additionally, the bunch self-focuses due to the effect of the magnetic field generated by the bunch current itself, that is not compensated for by the space-charge force, which is neutralized by the plasma [37–39]. As the bunch is progressively focused, it leaves the plasma with increasing divergence along the bunch, and possibly larger emittance, causing the transverse size to increase at the downstream screen. Because of this effect, we calculate the position of the centroid only for $t < 4 . 6$ ps.  \n On the contrary, when $n _ { P E } = 0 . 0 3 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 6 } ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ [Fig. 3(b)], plasma screening is not effective. In this case, $\\delta = 0 . 2 3 7 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ is not short enough to operate full screening, and the space-charge field of the bunch still reaches the dielectric surface, generating dielectric wakefields that affect the trajectory of the trailing part of the bunch. Thus, the horizontal position of the centroid along the bunch [red points in Fig. 3(c)] varies, in agreement with the case with no plasma [black points, same dataset as Fig. 2(d)]. We note that, in this case, dielectric wakefields (causing the centroid deflection) and plasma wakefields (causing the defocusing effect at the screen) are present at the same time.  \n Increasing $n _ { P E }$ decreases the distance from the propagation axis beyond which the space-charge field of the bunch is screened. Thus, for a small misalignment of the bunch trajectory with respect to the center of the dielectric capillary (i.e., a large distance from the surface), a lower $n _ { P E }$ is sufficient to suppress the dielectric wakefields than for a large misalignment (i.e., a short distance from the surface).  \n  \n Figure 4 shows the position of the centroid at $t = 3 . 6$ ps (a), 4.1 ps (b), and 4.6 ps (c) behind the front of the bunch as a function of $n _ { P E }$ , for three misalignment distances (see Legend). The displacement, which is due to the effect of the dielectric wakefields, decreases when increasing $n _ { P E }$ because the amplitude of the space-charge field reaching the dielectric surface is progressively more screened by plasma. The trend is in good agreement with the typical exponential decay expected from plasma screening. The solid lines show the result of the fit for each dataset, where the distance from the bunch to the dielectric surface is considered as a free parameter.  \n For $X = 0 . 3 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (black points), full screening (i.e., centroid position in agreement with the aligned case with no plasma) occurs for $n _ { P E } > 0 . 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 6 } ~ \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ (black dashed vertical line), corresponding to $\\delta < 0 . 0 6 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , that is ${ \\sim } 1 0$ times shorter than the distance between the bunch and capillary surface $R _ { c } - X = 0 . 6 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . For smaller misalignments, screening occurs at lower $n _ { P E }$ : for $R _ { c } - X = 0 . 7 5 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , $n _ { P E } > 0 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 6 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ $\\mathrm { \\delta \\delta < 0 . 0 7 5 m m }$ , red points and dashed vertical line); and for $R _ { c } - X = 0 . 8 7 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ , $n _ { P E } > 0 . 2 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 6 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ $\\delta < 0 . 1 0 9 \\mathrm { m m }$ , blue points and dashed vertical line). As expected from the screening process, $\\delta$ must be much shorter than the distance between the bunch and dielectric surface to obtain full screening. We also note that the ratio $( R _ { c } - X ) / \\delta$ at full screening increases when the misalignment increases. This is likely due to the finite transverse size of the bunch, as some particles are closer to the dielectric material than those at the bunch center.  \n  \n As the bunch travels in plasma, it can drive plasma wakefields that also have a transverse (periodically focusing or defocusing) component [6,7], generally growing along the bunch [see Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)]. However, the fact that the transition to full screening occurs at the same $n _ { P E }$ for all delays along the bunch, as highlighted by the vertical lines in Fig. 4, indicates that the screening of the spacecharge field is independent of the amplitude of the plasma wakefields. The displacement is larger for larger misalignments, at any $t$ along the bunch where the plasma screening is not fully effective because $w ( x , y )$ increases.  \n The experimental evidence we present in this work will have significant implications for designing and operating plasma-based accelerators. In particular, the direct observation of space-charge screening in plasma could be employed for managing misalignments and optimizing plasma conditions to minimize undesired wakefield effect.  \n Considering future PWFA, the operational $n _ { P E }$ and the transverse size of the capillary must be chosen so that the dielectric wakefields induced by misalignments (e.g., caused by jitters and finite accuracy of the alignment tools) are effectively screened by the plasma. In the case of EuPRAXIA $@$ SPARC_LAB [40], the diameter of the dielectric capillary will be $2 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and the operational density $n _ { P E } = 1 0 ^ { 1 6 } \\mathrm { { c m } } ^ { - 3 }$ . The maximum misalignment allowed to avoid the dielectric wakefields effect would therefore be even larger than $X = 0 . 3 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , as shown in this study, which is much larger than the state-of-the-art capabilities to align and control the trajectory of relativistic particle bunches (e.g., better than $2 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in our experiment). The measurement we present in this work could also be extended to a plasma electron density diagnostics, by measuring the maximum misalignment for which full screening of the space-charge field occurs.  \n Summary.—We investigated, with a noninvasive measurement, one of the fundamental characteristics of plasma, that is the screening of electromagnetic fields. We showed, using a plasma wakefield accelerator based on a dielectric capillary, that plasma screens the space-charge field of a relativistic $e ^ { - }$ bunch by measuring the suppression of dielectric wakefields. The effect of transverse dielectric wakefields increases along the bunch, following the same trend as the running sum of the bunch charge, in agreement with the theory. We observed a progressively increasing screening effect when increasing the plasma electron density, and therefore decreasing the plasma skin depth. We measured full screening to occur along the entire bunch when the distance from the bunch propagation axis to the dielectric surface is more than 10 times longer than the plasma skin depth. When full screening is not achieved, dielectric and plasma wakefields are present simultaneously. We also discussed the implications for future plasmabased accelerators based on dielectric capillaries.  \n The work of L.

Monitoring and characterization of channeled beams in the high energy accelerators environment ideally requires in-vacuum and radiation hard detectors. For this purpose the Cherenkov detector for proton Flux Measurement (CpFM) was designed and developed. It is based on thin fused silica bars in the beam pipe vacuum which intercept charged particles and generate Cherenkov light. The first version of the CpFM is installed since 2015 in the crystal-assisted collimation setup of the UA9 experiment.  \n In this paper the procedures to make the detector operational and fully integrated in the UA9 setup are described. The most important standard operations of the detector are presented. They have been used to commission and characterize the detector, providing moreover the measurement of the integrated channeled beam profile and several functionality tests as the determination of the crystal bending angle. The calibration has been performed with Lead $\\left( \\mathrm { P b } \\right)$ and Xenon (Xe) beams and the results are applied to the flux measurement discussed here in detail.  \n 1. Introduction  \n The primary goal of the UA9 experiment [1] is to demonstrate the feasibility of a crystal-based halo collimation as a promising and better alternative to the standard multi-stage collimation system for high-energy hadron machines. The main installation of the experiment is located in the Long Straight Section 5 (LSS5) of the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and consists of a crystal-assisted collimation prototype. It is made by preexisting optical elements of the SPS and new installations including three goniometers to operate different crystal types used as primary collimators, one dedicated movable absorber, several scrapers, detectors and beam loss monitors (BLMs) to study the interaction of the crystal with the beam halo [3]. A schematic of the layout of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1. The main process investigated is the so-called planar channeling: particles impinging on a crystal having a small angle (less than $\\theta _ { c }$ , called the critical angle for channeling) with respect to the lattice planes are forced by the atomic potential to move between the crystal planes. If the crystal is bent, the trapped particles follow the bending and are deflected correspondingly. When an optimized crystal intercepts the beam halo to act as collimator, about $8 0 \\%$ of the particles are channeled, coherently deflected and then dumped on the absorber (see Fig. 1), effectively reducing the beam losses in the sensitive areas of the accelerator [4–7].  \n  \n In order to fully characterize this collimation system, it is essential to steadily monitor the flux of the halo particles deflected by the crystal towards the absorber. Typical crystal-extracted fluxes range from $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ up to $1 0 ^ { 7 }$ protons/s (i.e. from 1 up to 200 protons per SPS revolution) and about $1 0 ^ { 5 }$ ions/s (1–3 ions per SPS revolution). Such a low flux does not allow to use the standard SPS instrumentation, for example BCTs (Beam Current Transformer [8]) which are optimized for higher fluxes ${ \\mathrm { ( > ~ } } 1 0 ^ { 9 }$ protons/s). For this reason, the Cherenkov detector for proton Flux Measurement (CpFM) was designed and developed.  \n 2. The Cherenkov detector for proton flux measurement  \n The CpFM detector has been devised as an ultra-fast proton flux monitor. It has to provide measurements of the extracted beam directly inside the beam pipe vacuum, discriminating the signals coming from different proton bunches in case of multi-bunch beams, with a 25 ns bunch spacing. It is also able to stand and to detect very low ion fluxes (1–3 ions per turn). The sensitive part of the detector is located in the beam pipe vacuum in order to avoid the interaction of the protons with the vacuum–air interface, hence preserving the resolution on the flux measurement. All the design choices are explained in detail in [9].  \n A conceptual sketch of the first version of the CpFM is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of two identical Fused Silica bars $( 5 \\times 1 0 \\times 3 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 3 }$ , $5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ along the beam direction) acting as Cherenkov light radiators and light guides at the same time. When a relativistic charge particle crosses a bar, it produces Cherenkov light that is transported by internal reflection to the other tip of the bar. One bar is $5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ closer to the center of the circulating beam than the other one and is devoted to the flux measurement. The second bar, retracted from the beam, provides background measurements. The vacuum–air interface is realized by a standard quartz viewport. The light signal from each bar is guided onto a PMT (HAMAMATSU R7378, anode pulse rise time $\\simeq ~ 1 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { n s }$ ) by a $4 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ long fused silica fibers bundle. The bars can gradually approach the extracted beam through a movable below on which the viewport is mounted. The PMTs are read-out by an ultra-fast analog memory, the 8-channels USB-WaveCatcher [10]. The first prototype of the detector was calibrated at the Beam Test Facility (BTF) of Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati with $4 5 0 \\mathrm { { M e V / c } }$ electrons and at the H8 external line of the North Experimental Area of CERN, with a $4 0 0 \\ { \\mathrm { G e V } }$ proton beam.  \n The relative resolution on the flux measurement of the CpFM for 100 incoming electrons was assessed to be $1 5 \\%$ , corresponding to a 0.62 photoelectron (ph.e.) yield per single particle [9,11,12]. The CpFM is installed in the SPS tunnel since 2015.  \n 2.1. Electronic readout and DAQ system  \n The CpFM electronic readout is realized by the 8-channels USBWaveCatcher board [10,13]. This is a 12-bit $3 . 2 \\mathsf { G S } / \\mathsf { s }$ digitizer; 6 other frequencies down to $0 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { G S } / s$ are also selectable via software. Each input channel is equipped with a hit rate monitor based on its own discriminator and on two counters giving the number of times the programmed discriminator threshold is crossed (also during the dead time period corresponding to the analog to digital conversion process) and the time elapsed with a 1 MHz clock. This allows to measure the hit rate. Each input channel is also equipped with a digital measurement block located in the front-end FPGA which permits extracting all the main features of the largest amplitude signal occurring in the acquisition window in real time (baseline, amplitude, charge, time of the edges with respect to the starting time of the acquisition).  \n The WaveCatcher is triggered by the UA9 trigger (common to all the other UA9 instrumentation). This trigger signal is the SPS revolution signal $( 4 3 \\mathrm { k H z } )$ down-scaled by a factor of 1000 and synchronized with the passage of a filled bucket in LSS5. The acquisition rate corresponds to the trigger frequency $( 4 3 ~ \\mathrm { H z } )$ . Three signals are acquired: two CpFM channels and the UA9 trigger itself. The board is equipped with a USB 2.0 interface for the data transfer.  \n The off-line analysis used to characterized the CpFM signal and to perform the event identification [13] is mainly based on the output of the measurement blocks.  \n 3. Procedures preliminary to data taking: readout settings optimization  \n Prior to every UA9 data taking a standard procedure is followed to prepare the detector for operation. It consists of checking the PMT gain stability and optimizing the gain of the PMTs and the settings of the WaveCatcher with respect to the characteristics of the beam to be measured.  \n 3.1. PMT gain stability check  \n The reliability of flux measurements depends on the stability of the calibration factor for which in turn the stability of the PMT performance is fundamental. For this reason, before every UA9 data taking, the stability of the PMT gain is checked through a simple procedure. It consists in a high-statistic ( $\\mathrm { 1 0 ^ { 5 } }$ trigger events) data acquisition of the CpFM signals when the detector is located at the parking position ${ \\mathrm { . 1 0 ~ c m } }$ from the beam pipe center) and the beam in the SPS is already in coasting mode.1 In this way, the amplitude distribution of the detector signals corresponds to the amplitude distribution of the background (Fig. 3), the latter being mostly composed by single photoelectron $( S _ { p h . e } )$ events plus a long tail due to particles showering by interacting with the aperture restrictions of the machine. If the PMTs are not affected by any gain variation, for example by radiation damage, the $S _ { p h . e }$ position in the amplitude distribution is unchanged.  \n  \n 3.2. PMT gain optimization  \n While choosing the PMT gain for both proton and ion runs, the maximum expected flux has to be considered together with the photoelectron yield per charge and the WaveCatcher dynamic range. To determine the optimal gain is noticed that the saturation of the ADC occurs at $2 . 5 \\mathrm { V }$ .  \n The typical proton beam setup during UA9 experiments is a single 2 ns long bunch of $1 . 1 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 1 }$ protons stored in the machine at the energy of $2 7 0 \\mathrm { G e V }$ [14]. For this beam intensity, the beam flux deflected by the crystal toward the CpFM ranges from 1 up to $\\simeq 2 0 0$ protons per turn (every ${ \\sim } 2 3 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s } .$ ), depending on the aperture of the crystal with respect to the beam center. In this case the optimal PMT gain is $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ corresponding to bias the PMT at $1 0 5 0 \\mathrm { V } .$ . When the PMT is operated at such a gain a $S _ { p h . e }$ corresponds to $\\mathord { \\sim } 1 5 \\mathrm { \\ m V }$ (Fig. 3); considering the calibration factor (0.62 photoelectron yield per charge, measured at BTF and H8 line) the average amplitude of the signal produced by 200 protons is much lower than the dynamic range of the digitizer, allowing furthermore a safety margin of about 70 protons per pulse.  \n The typical ion beam setup during UA9 data taking consists in few bunches of $1 . 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ fully stripped Lead (Pb) or Xenon (Xe) ions [14]. As in the case of protons, the ion beam is in coasting mode at the energy of $2 7 0 { \\mathrm { ~ G e V } }$ per charge. With such a beam intensity the ions to be measured by the CpFM per bunch and per turn is very low, from 0 to 3 ions. Nevertheless, since the Cherenkov light produced by a charged particle is proportional to the square of the charge of the particle , few ions can be enough to saturate the dynamic range of the electronics. Therefore the PMT gain has to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the gain used for protons.  \n The procedure followed for ions foresees to start with a bias voltage of $5 0 0 \\mathrm { V }$ , corresponding to a gain of $\\sim 2 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 }$ . Then, depending on the expected flux, it can be increased in steps of $1 0 0 \\mathrm { V }$ up to a maximum value of $7 0 0 \\mathrm { V }$ . This bias corresponds to a gain of $\\sim 2 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ , at which a flux of more than 1 ion per turn results, according to the calibration factor, in the saturation of the electronics.  \n 3.3. WaveCatcher settings optimization  \n In the following the optimal readout electronic settings are discussed with respect to the characteristics of the signal to be sampled.  \n Sampling frequency and digitizer window length. Since the PMT reading out the CpFM signal is very fast (rise time $\\simeq 1 . 5 \\mathrm { n s } ^ { \\cdot }$ ), the highest sampling frequency, $3 . 2 \\ { \\mathrm { G S } } / { \\mathrm { s } }$ , represents the best choice because it allows for a better reconstruction of the signal shape.  \n To use the $3 . 2 \\mathsf { G S } / \\mathsf { s }$ sampling frequency a fine synchronization of the CpFM signals and the UA9 trigger is needed, the digitizer being started by the latter. The choice of the sampling frequency and therefore of the window length, defined as 1024 sample points divided by the sample frequency, is also influenced by the setup of the beam. For example, with an ion beam in multi-bunch mode it could be useful to first study all the bunches and then choosing to sample and to reconstruct more precisely only one of them (see Fig. 4). In this case, first the $4 0 0 \\mathrm { M S } / s$ sampling mode has to be selected in order to have an overview of all the bunches. Using then the $3 . 2 \\mathsf { G S } / \\mathsf { s }$ mode and playing with the onboard trigger delay parameter, it is possible to center the window of the digitizer around the selected bunch. Moreover, having just one bunch in the digitizer window is essential to directly use the measurement block of the WaveCatcher. If more peaks are present in the same digitizer window, the measurement of the average parameters of the signal shape would be biased.  \n Hit rate monitor threshold. The hit rate monitor cannot be used to count the channeled particles because, if the beam is well bunched, they are deflected at the same time (or more precisely within the 2 ns of the bunch), producing a single signal shape proportional to their number. Nevertheless, the hit rate monitor can be effectively used to quickly find the channeling orientation of the crystal or to align the CpFM with respect to the beam. In this case the CpFM has to detect only changes in the counts rate. The absolute value of the rate is not important and thus the threshold of the hit rate monitor can be kept just over the electronic noise, corresponding to the pedestal of the amplitude distribution of the background shown in Fig. 3.  \n 4. An in-situ calibration strategy with ion beams  \n The SPS ion runs at the end of each year offer a possibility to calibrate in situ the detector. In fact in this case, the ph.e. yield per ion allows an excellent discrimination of the signal coming from 1, 2 or more ions.  \n The Cherenkov light produced by a single ion of charge $Z$ is $Z ^ { 2 }$ times the light produced by a single proton. For example, as the charge of a completely stripped Lead (Pb) ion is 82, the light produced by a single ion is equal to 6724 times the light produced by a proton. During SPS ion runs for the UA9 experiment, each $\\mathrm { \\sf P b }$ ion charge is accelerated to $2 7 0  { \\mathrm { ~ G e V } }$ , exactly as in UA9 proton beam runs. Identifying the amplitude signal corresponding to a single ion $( A _ { P b } )$ , the photoelectron yield per proton $( y )$ can be obtained as:  \n  \n $$\ny = \\frac { A _ { P b } } { Z _ { P b } ^ { 2 } \\times S _ { p h . e } \\left( m V \\right) }\n$$ \n where the $S _ { p h . e } ( \\mathrm { m V } )$ depends on the PMT bias and it can be obtained fitting the amplitude distributions in Fig. 3 and rescaling it to the PMT gain used for ions $_ { \\scriptstyle 7 0 0 \\mathrm { ~ V ~ } }$ in this case). The left side of the equation is provided by a data acquisition with both the bars intercepting the channeled beam. In this way the amplitude distribution of the channeled ions is easily obtained. This strategy has been applied for the first time during the Pb ion run in November 2016, providing reliable calibration factors for the flux measurement for those runs. In Fig. 5 the amplitude distributions of the CpFM channels are shown (CpFM 1 red line, CpFM 2 blue line) where only a rough requirement on the amplitude $( > 6 ~ \\mathrm { m V } )$ to cut the electronic noise has been applied. In the CpFM 1 distribution a three peak structure is present corresponding to 1, 2 and, just hinted, 3 ions. In the CpFM 2 distribution only one peak appears together with the ADC saturation occurring at 1.25 V.2 This is explained by different calibration factors. Fitting with a Gaussian function the single-ion peak as shown in Fig. 6(a) for CpFM 1 and inverting the Eq. (1), the calibration factors for the CpFM channels are: $y _ { C p F M 1 } = 0 . 0 6 6 \\pm 0 . 0 0 1 ( p h . e / p )$ and $y _ { C p F M 2 } = 0 . 1 8 6 2 \\pm 0 . 0 0 0 4 ( p h . e / p )$ for the CpFM 1 and the CpFM 2 respectively. The CpFM 2, devoted to the background measurement, results about 3 times more efficient than the CpFM 1; both the efficiency values are also lower with respect to the one of the CpFM prototype tested at the BTF. This was due to a problem during the installation investigated and solved during the SPS winter shut-down of 2016 [15].  \n The efficiency (𝜖) of this version of the detector is well described by an upper cumulative distribution function of a Binomial distribution $B ( k , n , p )$ , being $n$ the real number of incoming protons to be detected, $k$ the total number of photoelectrons produced by the $n$ protons and p the single proton efficiency of the CpFM:  \n $$\n\\epsilon = Q ( 1 , n , p ) = \\sum _ { t = 1 } ^ { n } B ( 1 , n , p )\n$$ \n Using this model with $p = y _ { C p F M }$ , the expected number of photoelectrons $( k )$ produced per $n$ protons can be determined. By multiplying $k$ with the value in $\\mathrm { m V }$ of one ph.e (corresponding to the peak in Fig. 3 at $1 0 5 0 \\mathrm { ~ V } )$ and by comparing the result with the amplitude of the electronic noise $\\zeta < 6 \\mathrm { m V }$ at 1050 V) is therefore possible to assert that the CpFM is effective in discriminating the proton signal if $n > 6$ for the CpFM 1 and $n > 2$ for the CpFM 2.  \n 5. Commissioning and operations  \n In this section the most common operations in which the detector is involved are described. During the commissioning phase they were also used to validate the functionality of the detector, allowing the measurement of some well know channeled beam and crystal characteristics.  \n The crystal assisted collimation prototype is composed essentially by the crystal bending in the horizontal plane and the absorber (Fig. 1). The crystal acts as a primary collimator deflecting the particles of the halo toward the absorber $\\sim 6 5 \\mathrm { m }$ downstream the crystal area) which has the right phase advance to intercept them and represents the secondary target. The CpFM is placed downstream to the crystal $( \\sim 6 0 \\mathrm { m } )$ and intercepts and counts the particles before they are absorbed. More details about the UA9 setup and the procedures to test the crystal collimation system can be found in [3].  \n 5.1. Standard operation: angular scan  \n The angular scan of the crystal is the UA9 standard procedure through which the channeling orientation of the crystal is identified and the experimental setup becomes operational. It consists in gradually varying the orientation of the crystal with respect to the beam axis, searching for the planar channeling and volume reflection3 regions [16], while the crystal transverse position is kept constant. When the optimal channeling orientation is reached, the number of inelastic interactions at the crystal is at minimum and the number of deflected particles is at its maximum. Consequently the loss rate measured by the BLMs close to the crystal should show a suppression while in the CpFM signal rate a maximum should appear.  \n In Fig. 7 the angular scan of the UA9 crystal-1 during a proton run is shown. It is displayed both by the BLMs and the CpFM (CpFM position is such that both the bars intercept the whole channeled beam when the crystal is in the optimal channeling position). The first and the last angular regions (angle $< - 2 7 0 0$ μrad and angle $> - 2 4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\mu r a d } )$ correspond to the amorphous orientation. As expected, here the loss rate registered by the BLMs is maximum while the CpFM signal rate is minimum. After the first amorphous region, the channeling peak appears (around angle of $- 2 6 2 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { r a d } )$ as a maximum in the CpFM rate and as minimum in the BLMs rate. Just after, only in the BLMs signal, the volume reflection area is clearly visible. In this angular region the particles experience a deflection to the opposite side with respect to the planar channeling deflection. For this reason volume reflection is not detectable by the CpFM except as a slight reduction in the background counts. Although the BLMs rate profile is an effective instrument for the estimation of the best channeling orientation, it is based on beam losses and is generally less sensitive than the CpFM rate profile which on the contrary measures directly the presence of channeled protons.  \n 5.2. Standard operation: Linear scan  \n The CpFM linear scan is the standard procedure needed to identify the CpFM position with respect to the primary and the channeled beam.  \n A fast linear scan (linear motor speed $\\sim 1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } / { \\sigma } )$ is performed at the very beginning of the operations, when the crystal has not been yet positioned in the channeling orientation, to align the CpFM with respect to the beam core. The CpFM is gradually inserted until the aperture of the detector corresponds to the beam aperture and a sharp spike is observed in the rate monitor of the WaveCatcher.  \n A slower linear scan (linear motor speed $\\sim 1 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m / s } )$ is instead performed when the crystal is already correctly oriented to extract the halo particles. Fig. 8(b) shows an example of slow scan for the proton run of October 2015. The plot shows the average amplitude value of both the channels of the CpFM as a function of the distance of the CpFM 1 with respect to the beam core. As expected, the CpFM 1 (red markers) bar starts to intercept the channeled protons first. The signal amplitude increases indeed on this channel. Around $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ from the beam core CpFM 1 detects the whole channeled beam and enters in the so-called channeling plateau where the amplitude signal is consequently constant. Moving the detector further inside the signal increases: initially it increases with a slow rate since the first bar intercepts the dechanneled4 particles, and then exponentially, when also particles interacting with the crystal as it was in the amorphous orientation are intercepted 8(a). These particles underwent multiple Coulomb scattering inside the crystal and thus they are displaced with respect to the beam core by few $\\mu \\mathrm { r a d }$ . The CpFM 2 (green markers) detects the same particle flux but with a spatial displacement of $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ with respect to the CpFM 1, being exactly $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ the distance between the two bars edges.  \n  \n 5.2.1. Channeled beam profile  \n In the channeling plateau, the linear scan shown in Fig. 8(b) basically corresponds to integrate the channeled beam profile in the horizontal plane. Therefore it can be fitted with an error function:  \n $$\ne r f ( x ) = A \\cdot { \\frac { 1 } { \\sigma { \\sqrt { 2 \\pi } } } } \\int _ { 0 } ^ { x } e ^ { - { \\frac { ( t - c ) ^ { 2 } } { 2 \\sigma ^ { 2 } } } } d t + K\n$$ \n Where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian beam profile, $\\scriptstyle { c }$ is the center of the channeled beam with respect to the primary one and $A$ and $K$ are constants related to the channeling plateau value and the background value.  \n In Fig. 8(b) CpFM 1 and CpFM 2 linear scan profiles of Fig. 8(b) have been fitted with the error function described in Eq. (3). From the results of the fits the channeled beam size $( \\sigma )$ at the position of the CpFM is obtained as well as some informations confirming the functionality of the detector: both the CpFM 1 and CpFM 2 measure compatible values of the channeled beam standard deviation $( \\sigma )$ and, as expected, the difference between the channeled beam center (c) measured by the CpFM 1 and the CpFM 2 is compatible with the design distance between CpFM 1 and CpFM 2 bar edges.  \n 5.2.2. Crystal bending angle and angular spread of the channeled beam at the crystal position  \n The results of the fits performed on the integrated beam profiles in Fig. 8(b) provide two additional functionality tests of the detector allowing to derive channeled beam and crystal characteristics already well known. In particular the center $( c )$ of the channeled beam can be used to determine the value of the bending angle $\\theta _ { b e n d }$ of the crystal. This represents a non perturbative method to measure in-situ the crystal bending angle, alternative to the linear scan of the LHC-type collimator used in the past [17]. The CpFM, unlike the collimator $\\mathrm { ~ \\ i m }$ of carbon fiber composite), is indeed almost transparent to the channeled protons which produce Cherenkov light losing a negligible amount of their energy.  \n $\\theta _ { b e n d }$ is derived calculating the equivalent crystal kick $\\theta _ { k }$ at the CpFM position along the ring. The latter corresponds to the angular kick that a particle should receive by the crystal to be horizontally displaced by $\\mathbf { x }$ with respect to the beam core at the CpFM position. It is derived applying the general transfer matrix to the phase-space coordinates of the particle at the crystal position $( x _ { 0 } , x _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } ) _ { c r y }$ to get the new coordinate at the CpFM position $( x , x ^ { \\prime } ) _ { C p F M }$ :  \n $$\n\\theta _ { k } = \\frac { x _ { C p F M } - \\sqrt { \\frac { \\beta _ { C p F M } } { \\beta _ { c r y } } } x _ { c r y } c o s \\varDelta \\phi } { \\sqrt { \\beta _ { c r y } \\beta _ { C p F M } } s i n \\varDelta \\phi }\n$$ \n being $\\beta _ { C p F M }$ and $\\beta _ { c r y }$ the betatron function at the CpFM and at the crystal location respectively and $\\Delta \\phi$ the phase advance between the crystal and the CpFM. These values are tabulated for the SPS machine [1] $\\mathit { \\hat { \\beta } } _ { c r y } = 8 7 . 1 1 5 4 \\mathrm { m } , \\beta _ { C p F M } = 6 9 . 1 9 2 0 \\mathrm { m } , \\Delta \\phi / 2 \\pi = 0 . 2 3 2 4 4$ . More details about this mathematical procedure can be found in [13]. When $x _ { C p F M } = c$ , the equivalent kick $\\theta _ { k }$ corresponds to the bending angle of the crystal $\\theta _ { b e n d }$ . Using the value of $c$ as extrapolated by the fit (see Fig. 8(b)) it is now possible to determine $\\theta _ { b e n d }$ corresponding to the crystal used during the scan: $\\theta _ { b e n d } = ( 1 6 7 \\pm 6 ) \\mu \\mathrm { r a d }$ . Its bending angle was previously measured by means of interferometric technics (Veeco NT1100) and resulted to be 176 μrad. The ${ \\sim } 5 \\%$ discrepancy with respect to the CpFM indirect measurement of the bending angle could depend on the imprecise evaluation of the primary beam center during the CpFM alignment procedure, not accounted in the error.  \n Using the value above and the value of the $\\sigma$ of the channeled beam obtained by the fit shown in Fig. 8(b), it is also possible to extrapolate the angular spread of the particles exiting the crystal. It can be derived subtracting the equivalent kick for $x _ { C p F M } = { \\bf c } \\pm \\sigma$ from $\\theta _ { b e n d }$ , corresponding to the equivalent kick calculated in the center $c$ of the channeled beam:  \n  \n $$\n\\theta _ { s p r e a d } = [ \\theta _ { k } ] _ { c \\pm \\sigma } \\mp \\theta _ { b e n d }\n$$ \n applying the Eq. (5) to the fit results in Fig. 8(b), the angular spread has been evaluated to be: $\\theta _ { s p r e a d } = ( 1 2 . 8 \\pm 1 . 3 ) \\mu \\mathrm { r a d }$ .  \n The angular spread at the exit of the crystal is directly connected to the critical angle value which defines the angular acceptance of the channeled particles at the entrance of the crystal. Therefore the angular spread should be comparable with respect to the critical angle. From theory [16], for $2 7 0 { \\mathrm { G e V } }$ protons in Si $\\theta _ { c }$ is $1 2 . 2 \\mu \\mathrm { r a d }$ .5 It can be then asserted that the angular spread derived by the fit results and the critical angle computed from the theory are well comparable.  \n 5.3. Flux measurement  \n The detector position optimal for the measurement of the channeled particle flux is the channeling plateau for the inner bar and the background position for the external one. In this position, the CpFM 1 bar intercepts the whole channeled beam while the CpFM 2 bar measures only the background. If both the channels have equal efficiency, a more accurate flux measurement is possible in this location since the background signal can be subtracted from the channeled beam signal on event by event basis. During the commissioning of the detector, both CpFM channels were tested in their own channeling plateau positions to compare the results of the flux measurement while both bars intercept the whole channeled beam. In Fig. 9(a) the linear scan profile performed in October 2016 with $2 7 0 \\ { \\mathrm { G e V } }$ protons is shown. It is a similar plot as the one shown in Fig. 8(b), but in this case the amplitude value is divided by the calibration factor, as found in Section 4 and expressed in mV/proton, to display the number of channeled protons extracted per turn. In Fig. 9(b) the distributions of number of protons related to the channeling plateau regions of CpFM 1 and CpFM 2 are shown. No event selection has been performed since a pedestal event is caused either by the physical absence of channeled particles or by the inefficiency of the detector. In fact, the absence of channeled particles could be connected to orbit instabilities, beam halo dynamics or to the inefficiency of the crystal-extraction system, with the latter under study by the CpFM detector. The inefficiency of the detector is already taken into account by the calibration factors. In Fig. 9(b) pedestal events are much more abundant in the CpFM 1 distribution than in the CpFM 2 distribution. In this case the pedestal events are mostly due to the inefficiency of the CpFM 1 bar, a factor of 3 worse than the efficiency of the CpFM 2 bar. Indeed, when the number of extracted particles is low $\\left( < ~ 6 \\right)$ , the CpFM 1 cannot discriminate extracted protons by the electronic noise. Both the channels count in average approximately the same number of protons per turn (on average about 137 protons/turn); the slight difference being due to the saturation of the electronics which occurs for the two channels at a different number of protons per pulse and with different percentages $1 \\%$ of the entries for CpFM 1, $1 0 \\%$ for CpFM2). In order to validate these results the flux extracted from the halo beam was estimated by the Beam Current Transformer (BCTDC [8]) installed in the SPS. BCTDC integrates the beam current along an SPS revolution $( 2 3 ~ \\mu s )$ measuring the total charge circulating in the machine. The time derivative of the BCTDC corresponds to the total particle flux leaving the machine; since the crystal acts as a primary target in the machine, the beam intensity variation can be assumed to be mainly caused by it and hence corresponding to the flux detected by the CpFM. This is an approximation as other minor losses can occur in the machine. With the typical fluxes extracted by the crystal $( 1 0 ^ { 5 } - 1 0 ^ { 7 } { \\bf p } / s )$ BCTDC measurements are only reliable when averaged over time intervals of several seconds. The extracted flux estimated by the BCTDC in the time interval related to Fig. 9(b) is $1 7 9 \\pm 4 2$ protons per turn. This value has to be considered in good agreement with the values of the flux measured by CpFM 1 and CpFM 2 remembering that the BCTDC measurement represents the upper limit estimation of the crystal-extracted flux.  \n  \n Finally, particular attention has to be paid to the shape of the distributions in Fig. 9(b). They are not Gaussian. For such a high fluxes, this cannot depend on the detector resolution, at least for the CpFM 2 channel which has the better efficiency. This can be demonstrated deriving the CpFM 2 resolution for an incident and constant flux of 180 protons per turn, as measured by the BCTDC. From the single ion distributions in Fig. 6(a), the resolution with respect to a single incident lead ion can be computed. The CpFM 2 resolution for 180 protons is easily derived scaling the ion resolution by the factor $\\sqrt { ( 6 7 2 4 / 1 8 0 ) }$ . It corresponds to $9 \\%$ . Thus, if the number of protons extracted by the crystal was constant and equal to 180 (distributed according a Gaussian distribution centered in 180), the CpFM 2 signal would be characterized by a narrower peak having 15 protons $\\sigma$ . The beam extracted by the crystal is therefore not constant on the time scale probed by the CpFM. There are several possible reasons for this: the diffusion dynamics of the halo beam, goniometer instabilities or orbit instabilities. The CpFM detector offers an interesting chance to address this issue at the μs scale but the current data acquisition electronics of the detector represent a limit. The CpFM detector is indeed able to accept only 1/1000 SPS trigger, since the data acquisition electronics are not fast enough $( < 1 \\mathrm { k H z } )$ . Faster electronics, matching the revolution frequency of the machine, could strengthen the detector capability in studying the impact of the listed factors on the crystal halo extraction.  \n  \n 6. CpFM 2.0: in-situ calibration with Xenon ions and first case study  \n During the winter shut-down of 2016, the layout of the CpFM detector was modified. In order to improve the detector efficiency, the fiber bundles were removed being indeed responsible for a reduction factor of 10 in the light yield per proton. They were initially foreseen to enhance the radiation hardness of the photo-detection chain and to make the detector concept eventually applicable also in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Only one PMT was directly coupled to the viewport and in such a way that the transversal cross section of both bars is covered. Moreover CpFM 1 and CpFM 2 bars were inverted, the latter being better polished and thus more efficient.  \n In December 2017, the second version of the CpFM detector was calibrated with a 270 GeV/charge Xenon (Xe, $Z ~ = ~ 5 4 )$ ion beam using the same procedure described in Section 4. In Fig. 10 the signal amplitude distribution focused on the Xenon ion events is shown. It is referred to a data taking performed during a crystal angular scan when only the inner bar intercepted the channeled beam. Beside the main peak due to Xe ions, two other structures appear. They are associated with fragments of charge $Z = 5 3$ and $Z = 5 2$ respectively, produced when the crystal is not in the optimal channeling orientation. Using the results of the fit, the new calibration factor is derived: $y _ { C p F M } =$ $2 . 1 \\pm 0 . 2 ( p h . e / p )$ . As expected it results improved by a factor of 10 with respect to the old version of the detector.  \n After the calibration, the detector was used to observe the particle population exiting $1 \\mathrm { m }$ long CFC (Carbon Fiber Composite) LHC-like collimator when Xenon ions are deflected onto it. The collimator is part of the UA9 crystal-assisted collimation setup. It is located downstream the crystals region and about $1 7 \\mathrm { m }$ upstream the CpFM. During the case study, the Xe ions were channeled and deflected onto the collimator. The CpFM were thus inserted to detect the channeled beam after the passage through the collimator. The measurement was repeated retracting the collimator. The results are shown in Fig. 11. The CpFM successfully discriminated the low-Z particle population (mostly $Z < 6 j$ ) resulting from the fragmentation of Xe ions inside the collimator from the Xe ions themselves.  \n 7. Conclusion  \n The CpFM detector has been developed in the frame of the UA9 experiment with the aim to monitor and characterize channeled hadron beams directly inside the beam pipe vacuum. It consists of fused silica fingers which intercept the particles deflected by the crystal and generate Cherenkov light. The CpFM is installed in the UA9 crystal collimation setup in the SPS tunnel since 2015. It has been successfully commissioned with different beam modes and with proton and ion beams and it is now fully integrated in the beam diagnostic of the experiment, providing the channeled beam flux measurement and being part of the angular alignment procedures of bent crystals. It is able to provide the channeled beam horizontal profile and the measurement of crystal-extracted flux with a relative resolution of about $1 \\%$ for 100 protons/bunch (CpFM 2.0). In order to improve the detector resolution for lower fluxes a new radiator geometry is under study.  \n The CpFM offers an interesting chance to investigate halo beam dynamics in the crystal-extraction process at the $\\mu s$ scale but the current data acquisition represents a limit. A faster data acquisition system, matching the revolution frequency of the SPS machine $( 4 3 \\mathrm { ~ k H z } )$ , could strengthen the detector capability to study and characterize crystal-extraction in a circular machine.  \n Acknowledgments  \n The authors would like to thank the other members of the UA9 Collaboration, the CERN EN/STI, Switzerland, BE/OP, BE/RF groups for the support during the commissioning and the operation of the detector.

        "text_data": "Three Dimensional Alternating-Phase Focusing for Dielectric-Laser Electron Accelerators  \n Uwe Niedermayer ,1\\* Thilo Egenolf ,1 and Oliver Boine-Frankenheim1,2 1Technische Universität Darmstadt, Schlossgartenstrasse 8, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany 2GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung GmbH, Planckstrasse 1, D-64291 Darmstadt, Germany (Received 11 April 2020; revised 21 August 2020; accepted 9 September 2020; published 13 October 2020)  \n  \n The concept of dielectric-laser acceleration (DLA) provides the highest gradients among breakdownlimited (nonplasma) particle accelerators and thus the potential of miniaturization. The implementation of a fully scalable electron accelerator on a microchip by two-dimensional alternating phase focusing (APF), which relies on homogeneous laser fields and external magnetic focusing in the third direction, was recently proposed. In this Letter, we generalize the APF for DLA scheme to 3D, such that stable beam transport and acceleration is attained without any external equipment, while the structures can still be fabricated by entirely two-dimensional lithographic techniques. In the new scheme, we obtain significantly higher accelerating gradients at given incident laser field by additionally exploiting the new horizontal edge. This enables ultralow injection energies of about $2 . 5 \\mathrm { \\ k e V }$ $( \\beta = 0 . 1 )$ ) and bulky high voltage equipment as used in previous DLA experiments can be omitted. DLAs have applications in ultrafast time-resolved electron microscopy and diffraction. Our findings are crucial for the miniaturization of the entire setup and pave the way towards integration of DLAs in optical fiber driven endoscopes, e.g., for medical purposes.  \n DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.125.164801  \n Dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) was already proposed in 1962 [1,2], however, first experiments came 50 years later [3,4] by means of femtosecond laser pulses and lithographic nanofabrication. Recent advances in ultrashort laser pulses have enabled demonstrations of damagethreshold and self-phase modulation limited record peak gradients approaching the $\\mathrm { G e V / m }$ milestone for relativistic electrons [5,6]. At subrelativistic energies, driven by a tabletop electrostatic preaccelerator, peak gradients of 133 [7] and $3 7 0 \\mathrm { M e V } / \\mathrm { m }$ [8] were achieved in silicon pillar structures. In order to create a functioning accelerator out of these impressive gradients, the interaction length needs to be increased while maintaining a stable 6D phase space confinement. Such a miniaturized accelerator has applications in attosecond science [9,10], ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction (UEM/UED) [11–15], lithography [16], and it would be possible to provide relativistic electrons within (e.g., medical) endoscopes [17].  \n First approaches to beam dynamics in grating linacs were already made in the 1980s [18–20]. In 2012, Naranjo et al. [21] showed that the nonsynchronous spatial (sub)harmonics can provide a ponderomotive focusing force, which was later turned into an accelerator design for medium energy [22].  \n Our approach starts from showing that a periodic grating provides phase dependent forces which can be concentrated in one kick per grating cell [23]. Per Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [24], this three-dimensional kick is irrotational, and can thus be modeled as a (time-dependent) potential in the Hamiltonian. Removing the time dependence is achieved by lattice integration of the linearized fields according to the Courant-Snyder (CS) theory [25]. An accelerator lattice design providing stable motion in the longitudinal and one transverse direction is obtained by an alternating phase focusing (APF) arrangement of grating segments treated as thick lenses [26]. Full scalability of the APF DLA is achieved by using a pulse-front-tilted laser [27–29] or an on-chip photonic waveguide system [30], which in principle allows us to work with arbitrary short pulses.  \n The equivalent magnetic focusing strength of an individual APF segment was predicted [26] and experimentally demonstrated to be in the MT/m range [31]. Moreover, the energy modulation of a subrelativistic DLA can also be turned into ballistic bunching [10,32–34]; however, the hereby created energy spread is too large to inject into a scalable APF DLA accelerator. A proposed APF-based segmented buncher [26] solves this problem and is currently being experimentally tested. Another ongoing experiment is the demonstration of a periodically segmented APF transport channel [35], which is however limited in length by the Rayleigh range of the electron beam in the invariant direction. In [26], we proposed to overcome this limit by installing an external quadrupole magnet which constantly focuses the beam in the vertical direction. A major challenge in the experimental realization of a fully scalable APF DLA is the alignment of this external magnet and the sufficient homogeneity of the laser fields in the invariant vertical direction of the structure.  \n  \n In this Letter, we generalize the APF-based confinement to both transverse directions. This enables to completely eliminate external focusing devices in scalable DLAs of arbitrary length. Moreover, since the additional dimension provides an additional edge, the accelerating near-field is increased, which results in either higher gradient, or allows us to push for lower injection energy at given aperture. Previously reported minimal injection energies of $9 . 6 \\mathrm { \\ k e V }$ [36] required using higher harmonics (in [36] the fifth) and confinement was not attained. Here, we intend to stay at the first harmonic since it provides the slowest dropoff from the grating surface and thus the highest center gradient. We show, that injection energies of 16.75 and $2 . 5 \\mathrm { \\ k e V }$ are attainable at laser wavelengths of 2 and $6 \\mu \\mathrm m$ , respectively. Thus, bulky high voltage feedthroughs in the experimental chambers can be entirely omitted.  \n The 3D APF-based DLA can still be fabricated by 2D lithographic techniques. The key idea is to work with two materials, exhibiting an as high as possible refractive index contrast, see Fig. 1. Such technology is already commercially available in nanoelectronics and -photonics, e.g., as silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers [37], and has been used to demonstrate a waveguide driven DLA recently [38]. The refractive indices at $2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ are [39] $n _ { \\mathrm { S i } } = 3 . 6 7$ and $n _ { \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } } = 1 . 4 4$ , respectively. At first, we make the approximation of $n _ { \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } } \\approx 1$ , which will be later refined. In other words, the oxide serves as just a building brick to construct 3D silicon structures by 2D lithography, where the layer thickness $h$ and the pillar semiaxis radii can attain single digit nanometer precisions.  \n  \n To model the electromagnetic fields in the (quasi) periodic structures, we first look at the Helmholtz wave equation, in temporal frequency domain and Fourier series expanded in the longitudinal direction (see the Supplemental Material [40]),  \n $$\n[ \\triangle _ { \\perp } - k _ { z } ^ { 2 } + \\omega ^ { 2 } / c ^ { 2 } ] e _ { 1 } ( x , y ) = 0 ,\n$$ \n where $\\triangle _ { \\perp }$ is the transverse Laplacian, $k _ { z } = \\omega / ( \\beta c )$ is the longitudinal wave number of the synchronous mode $e _ { 1 }$ to an electron traveling at speed $\\beta c$ and $\\omega = 2 \\pi c / \\lambda$ . Equation (1) is valid only in the vacuum of the beam channel. In contrast to conventional metallic accelerators, boundary conditions, necessary to solve Eq. (1), are not available. We can however determine the dispersion relation from Eq. (1) by $\\partial _ { x }  - i k _ { x } , \\partial _ { y }  - i k _ { y }$ , and $\\gamma ^ { 2 } = 1 / ( 1 - \\beta ^ { 2 } )$ as  \n $$\nk _ { x } ^ { 2 } + k _ { y } ^ { 2 } = { \\frac { \\omega ^ { 2 } } { c ^ { 2 } } } - k _ { z } ^ { 2 } = - { \\frac { \\omega ^ { 2 } } { \\beta ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } c ^ { 2 } } } = : - \\kappa ^ { 2 } ,\n$$ \n which is plotted in Fig. 2. Instead of solving Eq. (1), we only need to determine $e _ { 1 0 } = e _ { 1 } ( 0 , 0 )$ and one transverse wave number, which can be done numerically (see the Supplemental Material [40]), for each individual grating cell. The transverse dependence of $\\boldsymbol { e } _ { 1 }$ can then be written analytically as  \n $$\ne _ { 1 } ( x , y ) = e _ { 1 0 } \\cosh ( i k _ { x } x ) \\cosh ( i k _ { y } y ) ,\n$$ \n which is numerically confirmed within $5 \\%$ in the channel $w \\times h$ and plotted in Fig. 1 over a slightly larger range. The assumption that the oxide can be neglected is crosschecked in Fig. 3 (top), where $\\left| e _ { 1 0 } \\right|$ , $k _ { x }$ , and $k _ { y }$ are compared for a free-floating simplified pillar, a full pillar with the origin centered in $h$ , and a full pillar with the origin slightly shifted towards the substrate. Since the curves agree to sufficient accuracy, we will continue with the simplified pillars for brevity. Figure 3 (bottom) shows a direct comparison of the peak gradient and focusing strength to the 2D case [26] for higher velocity, where an up to twofold gradient enhancement is visible. The enhancement is even larger at lower $\\beta$ , where the dropdown of $\\boldsymbol { e } _ { 1 }$ renders the 2D scheme unfeasible.  \n  \n For the laser traveling in $\\pm y$ direction and polarized in $z$ direction, $i k _ { y }$ is always a purely real number. However, $i k _ { x }$ can either be purely real or purely imaginary, see Fig. 2. We will refer to these cases as in-phase and counterphase scheme, indicating whether or not both transverse planes are simultaneously focused.  \n With no loss of generality, we continue with the counterphase scheme only, since the structures are straightforward to fabricate on SOI wafers. The dependence of the wave numbers $k _ { x / y }$ as well as $e _ { 1 0 }$ on the height $h$ of a free-floating pillar is plotted in Fig. 4. The oscillation of $\\left| e _ { 1 0 } \\right|$ is due to eigenmodes arising in the $x$ direction. Subsequently, the 2D case holds only for discrete values of $h$ . These roots (and the corresponding maxima) of $k _ { x }$ are not robust with respect to perturbations such as attaching the pillar to the oxide or to the substrate. Robust counterphase focusing behavior is found below the first root of $k _ { x }$ and we choose $h = 0 . 2 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (commercially available [37], vertical black line in Fig. 4), slightly below this first maximum.  \n In contrast to [26], the pillar shape is kept constant, i.e., $r _ { z } = 2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ and $r _ { y } = 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ for Fig. 3 (top) and $r _ { z } = 4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ and $r _ { y } = 3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ for Fig. 3 (bottom), which set the minimum $\\beta$ to roughly 0.25 and 0.45, respectively. The occurring phase drift as function of $\\beta = \\lambda _ { g } / \\lambda$ is compensated by shifting the pillar center off the cell center by $\\Delta z ^ { ( n ) } = \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( n ) } [ \\arg ( e _ { 1 0 } ^ { ( n ) } ) - \\arg ( e _ { 1 0 } ^ { ( 1 ) } ) ] / 2 \\pi ,$ see the  \n Supplemental Material [40]. The gradient can be further optimized by using a few additional pillar designs at different $\\beta$ . Moreover, fabrication errors for identical pillars are systematic and thus correctable, which decisively simplifies the fabrication and error estimation processes.  \n With the above knowledge of the electromagnetic field, we proceed to the Hamiltonian $H = \\Delta \\vec { P } ^ { 2 } / ( 2 m _ { e } \\gamma ) + V$ , where $\\Delta \\vec { P } = ( p _ { x } , p _ { y } , \\Delta p _ { z } / \\gamma ) ^ { T }$ is the momentum deviation from the reference particle and $m _ { e }$ is the electron rest mass. The time-dependent potential $V$ reads generally (same procedure as in [26]) as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { V ( x , y , s ) = q \\mathrm { I m } \\{ k _ { z } ^ { - 1 } e _ { 1 } ( x , y ) e ^ { i k _ { z } s } - i s e _ { 1 0 } e ^ { i \\varphi _ { s } } \\} , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $q$ is the (negative) electron charge, $s$ is the relative longitudinal coordinate with respect to the laser phase, and $\\varphi _ { s }$ is the synchronous phase at which the reference particle gains energy according to the design acceleration ramp. Tracking with the nonlinear kicks according to Eq. (4) is performed by DLAtrack6D [23]. Expanding Eq. (4) to second order, Hamilton’s equations provide Hill’s equations  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { \\Delta s ^ { \\prime \\prime } + K _ { s } \\Delta s = 0 , } \\\\ { \\ } \\\\ { y ^ { \\prime \\prime } + K _ { y } y = 0 , } \\\\ { \\ } \\\\ { x ^ { \\prime \\prime } + K _ { x } x = 0 , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $\\Delta s = s - \\lambda _ { g } \\varphi _ { s } / 2 \\pi$ . Due to the absence of first order terms in $V$ , the linearized motion is decoupled. The focusing functions are  \n $$\nK _ { s } = - \\frac { k _ { z } ^ { 2 } } { \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\frac { \\left| q e _ { 1 0 } \\right| } { m _ { e } \\beta \\gamma c \\omega } \\sin ( \\varphi _ { s } ) ,\n$$ \n $$\nK _ { y } = ( i k _ { y } ) ^ { 2 } \\frac { \\left| q e _ { 1 0 } \\right| } { m _ { e } \\beta \\gamma c \\omega } \\sin ( \\varphi _ { s } ) ,\n$$ \n $$\nK _ { x } = ( i k _ { x } ) ^ { 2 } \\frac { | q e _ { 1 0 } | } { m _ { e } \\beta \\gamma c \\omega } \\sin ( \\varphi _ { s } ) ,\n$$ \n and fulfill $K _ { x } + K _ { y } + K _ { s } = 0$ according to Eq. (2), which reflects Earnshaw’s theorem [44]. Note that $K _ { s }$ is the same as $K$ in the 2D scheme [26] and the $s$ and $y$ planes are alternatingly focused by switching $\\varphi _ { s }$ using fractional period drifts. The numerical value of $K _ { y }$ is however different from the 2D case and thus all three frequencies and phase advances are disparate. As compared to 2D, the 3D APF provides significantly higher values of $e _ { 1 0 }$ , $k _ { x }$ , and $k _ { y }$ , which allows us to push for lower injection energy while the confinement is maintained. Moreover, for $\\beta \\to 1$ , $K _ { x }$ and $K _ { y }$ scale as $\\gamma ^ { - 1 }$ since $k _ { x }$ and $k _ { \\mathrm { y } }$ remain constant, whereas in the 2D scheme a faster $\\gamma ^ { - 3 }$ decay occurs (cf. Fig. 3).  \n This general description of the motion is now turned into a functioning accelerator that provides 3D particle confinement by individual CS lattice integration [25] in each plane x, y, s. As in [26], the lattice functions in Eqs. (6) are converted to CS-functions (also called Twiss parameters)  \n $\\boldsymbol { \\eta } = ( \\hat { \\beta } , \\hat { \\alpha } , \\hat { \\gamma } ) ^ { T }$ by solving the Twiss map eigenvector problem $\\eta _ { 0 } = \\mathbf { T } \\eta _ { 0 }$ for the initial values and subsequently mapping them to any other position.  \n The maxima of the $\\hat { \\boldsymbol { \\beta } }$ functions for a strictly periodic APF cell at $\\beta = 0 . 2 5$ are plotted in Fig. 5. To avoid electron loss at the aperture, the cell length of choice should minimize these three maxima at given laser amplitude. A suitable (not unique) multiobjective optimal cell length, i.e., an element of the Pareto front, is given by the minimum of the arithmetic average of these three maxima-curves.  \n At given injection energy we pick the synchronous phase as a compromise between desired acceleration gradient and required longitudinal focusing strength. The laser field strength is picked as slightly below the damage threshold fluence for a (curved-tilted) 100 fs pulse. A laser amplitude of $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { M V / m }$ from each side and a synchronous phase of $\\pm 6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ off crest are chosen, leading to an average gradient of $G \\approx \\cos ( \\varphi _ { s } ) \\langle | e _ { 1 0 } | \\rangle \\approx 7 3 ~ \\mathrm { { M e V / m } }$ . Laser pulse shape and exact average gradient are detailed in the Supplemental Material [40].  \n The periodic solutions and their Twiss maps $\\mathbf { T } _ { P } ^ { x , y , s }$ for the optimal cell length as indicated in Fig. 5 are determined for a continuum of velocities $\\beta$ . Usually, a lattice obtained by simple matrix mapping of $\\eta _ { 0 }$ will exhibit growing $\\hat { \\boldsymbol { \\beta } }$ functions, due to cumulation of the small mismatch between two APF cells. Smooth and slowly growing $\\hat { \\boldsymbol { \\beta } }$ functions, such that the envelopes $a = ( \\hat { \\beta } \\varepsilon ) ^ { 1 / 2 }$ are nongrowing, are obtained by manual correction of the segment lengths, which slightly squeezes the beam in one direction at the expense of another. Note that a slight growth of $\\hat { \\boldsymbol { \\beta } }$ is tolerable, since the emittance decreases by adiabatic damping according to $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon _ { n } / ( \\beta \\gamma )$ , where the normalized emittance $\\varepsilon _ { n }$ is an invariant of the linearized motion.  \n  \n The resulting energy ramp and envelopes for a structure that accelerates from $1 6 . 7 5 \\ \\mathrm { k e V }$ $\\langle \\beta = 0 . 2 5 )$ to $7 0 . 2 9 \\mathrm { ~ k e V }$ $( \\beta = 0 . 4 8 )$ , consisting of 945 cells and 74 APF jumps, are plotted in Fig. 6 (top). After a full 3D field simulation [45], the complex field result along the channel is plotted below. Windowing this global field for each DLA cell allows a comparison between the $e _ { 1 0 } ^ { ( n ) }$ in the entire accelerator to the individual $e _ { 1 0 } ^ { ( n ) }$ initially computed under periodic boundary conditions (cf. Fig. 3). As visible, the phase drift compensation keeps $\\arg ( e _ { 1 0 } ^ { ( n ) } )$ constant, but at the $\\varphi _ { s }$ jumps a Gibbs phenomenon occurs. This is the main source of excess emittance growth and particle loss (cf. Fig 7).  \n The injection parameters were chosen as Gaussian distributions with geometric emittances $\\varepsilon _ { x } = 1 2$ pm, $\\varepsilon _ { x } = 7 \\ \\mathrm { p m }$ , and bunch length $\\sigma _ { s } = 5 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ with matched energy spread. These values are at the most sensitive beam loss clipping point and beam loss occurs in the lowest energy section of the accelerator. The throughput and energy spread is shown in Fig. 7 for one kick per cell vs 3D full field tracking. Similar results for $2 . 5 \\mathrm { \\ k e V }$ $( \\beta = 0 . 1 )$ to $1 6 . 7 5 \\mathrm { ~ k e V }$ $( \\beta = 0 . 2 5 )$ using $\\lambda = 6 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ are discussed in the Supplemental Material [40] and in principle, one could even start at a few $\\mathrm { e V }$ only, by using a Terahertz driver. However, lowering the injection energy poses a challenge to the robustness. Structure bandwidth, fabrication tolerances, and injection energy mismatch have to be controlled more precise. Normalized emittances in the single digit picometer range are available [46,47], however, after the electrostatic preaccelerator mostly higher values are reported (e.g., [48,49]). This is due to nonlinear aberrations in the electrostatic lensing system. Our findings ease this problem significantly, since aberrations scale with the overall size of the system, which can be significantly reduced at lower injection energy. As confirmed by full 3D simulation, the 3D APF DLA scheme on SOI wafers is ready for experimental testing in different energy ranges. Moreover, DLAs with 6D confinement improve our ability to keep the energy spread small over long distance, e.g., to observe and control electron matter waves [50–54].  \n More detailed theoretical studies are required to assess the effects of nonlinear and coupled tune spread and emittance evolution, e.g., with the extended DLAtrack6D [55].  \n U.

Mori2, Patric Muggli3, Erdem ${ \\mathsf { O } } z ^ { 3 }$ , Robert H. Siemann1, Dieter Walz1 & Miaomiao Zhou2  \n The energy frontier of particle physics is several trillion electron volts, but colliders capable of reaching this regime (such as the Large Hadron Collider and the International Linear Collider) are costly and time-consuming to build; it is therefore important to explore new methods of accelerating particles to high energies. Plasma-based accelerators are particularly attractive because they are capable of producing accelerating fields that are orders of magnitude larger than those used in conventional colliders1–3. In these accelerators, a drive beam (either laser or particle) produces a plasma wave (wakefield) that accelerates charged particles4–11. The ultimate utility of plasma accelerators will depend on sustaining ultrahigh accelerating fields over a substantial length to achieve a significant energy gain. Here we show that an energy gain of more than $4 2 \\mathbf { G e V }$ is achieved in a plasma wakefield accelerator of ${ \\bf 8 5  c m }$ length, driven by a $4 2 \\mathbf { G e V }$ electron beam at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Most of the beam electrons lose energy to the plasma wave, but some electrons in the back of the same beam pulse are accelerated with a field of ${ \\sim } 5 2 \\mathrm { G V } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ . This effectively doubles their energy, producing the energy gain of the 3-km-long SLAC accelerator in less than a metre for a small fraction of the electrons in the injected bunch. This is an important step towards demonstrating the viability of plasma accelerators for high-energy physics applications.  \n In a plasma wakefield accelerator large-amplitude electric fields result from space-charge waves excited by the passage of an ultrarelativistic electron beam through a plasma12. A fully ionized plasma can be formed in a neutral vapour when the radial electric field of the electron beam exceeds the field ionization threshold13. The ionization occurs in a narrow region in the front of the beam. This ionization front produces a plasma that has a radius much larger than the beam itself. If the beam density exceeds the plasma density, the plasma electrons are expelled from the volume of the electron pulse, leaving a column of more massive ions behind14. Subsequently, the expelled plasma electrons are pulled back (by the ions) to the beam axis behind the pulse, overshoot, and set up a space-charge oscillation or wake. The longitudinal field of this wake varies continuously along the pulse, decelerating its core but accelerating the particles in the back. The ion column also provides a focusing force15 that guides the beam over many diffraction lengths, allowing an efficient transfer of the beam energy to the wake. This force also causes the transverse size of the beam to oscillate as it propagates through the plasma—the socalled betatron oscillations (see Supplementary Movie 1).  \n Recent plasma wakefield accelerator experiments have shown high-gradient acceleration of electrons using a 10-cm-long plasma11. To obtain energy gains of interest to high-energy physics, these high gradients must be extended over metre-scale plasmas. Such an extension transitions the plasma wakefield accelerator from a regime in which the drive beam has no time to distort, deplete or go unstable, to a regime in which it is significantly depleted in energy, deformed owing to combined effects of diffraction and multiple transverse oscillations, and possibly goes unstable because of the electron-hose instability16. This work is in this latter regime.  \n A schematic of the experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1. In the present work carried out at the Final Focus Test Beam facility at SLAC, the nominally 50-femtosecond-long electron beam containing $1 . 8 \\times { { 1 0 } ^ { 1 0 } }$ particles is focused to a spot size of ${ \\sim } 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ at the entrance of an $8 5 \\mathrm { - c m }$ -long column of lithium vapour with a density $n _ { \\mathrm { e } }$ of $2 . 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 7 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ . The nominally $4 2 \\mathrm { G e V }$ beam has a correlated energy spread of approximately $1 . 5 \\mathrm { G e V }$ , with electrons in the front of the beam at higher energies than those at the back. The beam exiting the plasma traverses a metre-long dipole magnet, which disperses the beam electrons according to their energy. The transverse distribution of the dispersed electrons is measured at two distances (planes 1 and 2 in Fig. 1) downstream of the dipole magnet to distinguish the energy changes of the electrons from their possible transverse deflection due to the plasma.  \n Images of the dispersed electrons are recorded along with the relevant beam parameters on a shot-to-shot basis. The energy gain achieved for each shot is determined as described in the Methods section. Figure 2 shows one example of the electron energy distribution between 35 and $1 0 0 \\mathrm { G e V }$ after traversing the plasma. The angle $\\theta _ { 0 }$ at the plasma exit for this particular event was calculated to be smaller than $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { r a d }$ , which is negligible; therefore energy relates directly to position. The highest electron energy is $8 5 \\pm 7 \\mathrm { G e V } _ { \\mathrm { ; } }$ , indicating that some electrons in the tail of the beam with an initial energy of 41 GeV have more than doubled their initial energy. The implied peak accelerating field of ${ \\sim } 5 2 \\mathrm { G V } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ is consistent with the fields previously measured in a $1 0 \\mathrm { - c m }$ -long plasma11, indicating that the energy gain is scalable by extending the length of the plasma at least up to $8 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ . With this plasma length, in a series of 800 events, $3 0 \\%$ showed an energy gain of more than $3 0 \\mathrm { G e V }$ . Variations in the measured energy gain were correlated to fluctuations in the peak current of the incoming electron beam.  \n  \n When the length of the lithium vapour column was extended from $8 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ to $1 1 3 \\mathrm { c m }$ , the maximum energy in an event with a similar incoming current profile was measured to be $7 1 \\pm 1 1 \\mathrm { G e V }$ . Less than $3 \\%$ of a sample of 800 consecutive events showed an energy gain of more than $3 0 \\mathrm { G e V }$ . There are three possible reasons for this apparent saturation of energy gain observed in the experiment. The first is that the energy of the particles that produced the wake has been depleted to almost zero, such that the acceleration is terminated in the last $2 8 \\mathrm { c m }$ of the plasma. However, the minimum energy measured at plane 1 (not shown) was $5 { \\mathrm { - } } 7 { \\mathrm { G e V } } ;$ , which is inconsistent with this explanation. The second possible reason is that the electron hosing instability is so severe that the beam breaks $\\mathrm { u p } ^ { 1 6 }$ . In the data shown in Fig. 2 there are negligible transverse deflections of the various longitudinal slices of the beam, indicating an absence of the hosing instability. The third possibility is head erosion: the front of the beam expands, because it is not subjected to the focusing force of the ion column. This expansion decreases the beam density, which moves the ionization front backward in the beam frame. Eventually the beam electric field drops below the threshold for plasma formation, terminating the acceleration process before the energy of the drive beam is depleted (see Supplementary Movie 1).  \n  \n We used simulations to explain the maximum electron energy observed in the experiment. Figure 2b shows a comparison of the measured energy spectrum with one derived from simulations. The electron current distribution is extracted from the energy spectrum of the beam measured upstream of the plasma by comparing it to a phase space simulation using the code LiTrack17. The wakefield from this current distribution and the propagation of the pulse through the plasma are modelled using the three-dimensional, parallel particle-in-cell (3D-PIC) code QuickPIC18. QuickPIC includes the effects of field ionization and electron energy loss due to radiation19 from oscillations in the ion column.  \n Figure 3a and b shows the simulation output at two different positions in the plasma. At a distance of $1 2 . 3 \\mathrm { c m } .$ , the wake produced by the motion of the plasma electrons resembles that produced in a preformed plasma, because the ionization occurs near the very head of the beam. The expelled plasma electrons return to the beam axis at nearly the same $z$ location. This gives rise to an extremely large spike in the accelerating field. After $8 1 . 9 \\mathrm { c m }$ one can see the effect of beam head erosion in that the ionization front now occurs further back along the pulse. Even though the wake is formed further back, the peak accelerating field occurs at approximately the same position along the pulse. The transverse size of the pulse ahead of the ionization front is so large that the local beam density has dropped below the useful range in the colour table. However, the modified ionization front causes some blurring of the position at which the returning plasma electrons arrive on the axis, an effect known as phase mixing. This not only reduces the peak accelerating field but also leads to some defocusing of the high-energy beam electrons in this region (see Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary Figs 1–4).  \n The simulated energy distribution at this point was binned equivalently to the experimental data, as shown in Fig. 2b. The quantitative agreement between the two spectra is good. In the simulation spectrum of Fig. 2b, electrons are accelerated to a maximum energy of $9 5 \\mathrm { G e V }$ . In the experiment, the maximum detectable energy is determined by the spot size at the detection plane, and the highest detected energy is $8 5 \\mathrm { G e V } .$ . For the present case, this corresponds to a detection threshold of $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ electrons per GeV. The mean electron energy of the highest energy bin containing $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ electrons per GeV in the simulation is shown as a function of position along the plasma in Fig. 3c. Also shown are maximum energies measured in the experiment at 85 and $1 1 3 \\mathrm { c m }$ for similar electron current profiles. The energy in the simulation increases approximately linearly with propagation distance up to a value of $8 0 \\mathrm { G e V }$ at about $7 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ and then saturates at $8 5 \\mathrm { G e V }$ at $8 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ owing to the phase-mixing effect, which leads to gradual defocusing of the highest energy electrons as mentioned above. As the beam propagates beyond $8 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ , the highestenergy electrons continue to be defocused to such an extent that at $1 0 4 \\mathrm { c m }$ a significant number of the high-energy electrons are lost to the simulation walls, causing the maximum observed electron energy to drop to $6 0 \\mathrm { G e V } .$ . In the experiment, electrons defocused at such angles would not be detectable in the electron spectrometer. It should be noted that no significant wakefield is left beyond $1 0 4 \\mathrm { c m }$ , because the electron beam core containing the bulk of the particles is completely eroded away.  \n The simulations have reproduced the energy spectrum seen in the experiment for an 85-cm-long plasma and elucidated the underlying physical mechanism, head erosion, which leads to the observed saturation of the maximum energy. This effect can be avoided by the use of a lower-emittance beam such that its diffraction length is longer than the plasma length. In that case, the maximum energy gain would be determined by the energy of the drive beam.  \n Thus, we have produced an accelerating field of $5 2 \\mathrm { G V } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ in a plasma wakefield accelerator and sustained it for $8 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ . The result is in excellent agreement with 3D-PIC simulations. By producing the energy gain of the 3-km-long SLAC accelerator in less than a metre, albeit for a relatively small number of electrons, we have taken an important step towards demonstrating the viability of plasma accelerators for high-energy physics.  \n METHODS  \n Electron pulses. A 6-mm-long electron pulse from the SLAC damping ring undergoes three stages of longitudinal compression. In each of these stages, a time-dependent energy is added to the pulse, which is followed by magnetic transport elements that compress the pulse. As a result, the originally $6 \\mathrm { - m m }$ - long pulses are compressed by a factor of 500 to a minimum length of $1 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (ref. 20). Such a large compression is sensitive to the phases and amplitudes of the klystrons powering the accelerating sections of the linear accelerator, leading to some pulse-to-pulse variation in the bunch length.  \n The beam has geometric transverse emittances of $\\varepsilon _ { x } = 9 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } \\mathrm { m }$ and $\\varepsilon _ { y } = 1 . 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } \\mathrm { m }$ . It is focused with a quadrupole doublet to a spot with $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ radius at the entrance of the plasma. With this beam energy, bunch length and spot size, the corresponding power density is $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 0 } \\mathrm { W } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ .  \n Plasma generation. A column of lithium vapour with a density of $2 . 7 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 7 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ is produced in a heat-pipe oven21. The lithium vapour is confined by a helium buffer gas, which is in turn separated from the beam-line vacuum by a $5 0 \\mathrm { - } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ -thick beryllium window upstream and by a $7 5 \\mathrm { - } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ -thick beryllium window downstream. Lithium was chosen because of the low ionization potential of its first electron $( 5 . 4 \\mathrm { e V } )$ and the relatively high potential for its two subsequent electrons (76 and $1 2 2 \\mathrm { e V }$ ). In the present experiments the transverse electric field of the ultrashort electron pulses is large enough to field-ionize the first lithium electron over a timescale shorter than the bunch duration. The ADK theory for field ionization22 indicates that full ionization occurs in the volume surrounding the pulse in which the electric field exceeds ${ \\sim } 6 \\mathrm { G V m } ^ { - 1 }$ .  \n Thus, the full ionization extends over a radius of more than $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and ionization begins far earlier than the peak of the bunch current. Because the ionization region extends over a radius larger than the plasma collisionless skin depth $c / \\omega _ { \\mathrm { p } } ,$ where $\\omega _ { \\mathrm { p } } = ( n _ { \\mathrm { e } } e ^ { 2 } / \\varepsilon _ { 0 } m _ { \\mathrm { e } } ) ^ { 1 / 2 }$ is the plasma angular frequency; $e$ is the charge on the electron, $\\scriptstyle { \\varepsilon _ { 0 } }$ is the permittivity of free space and $m _ { \\mathrm { e } }$ is the mass of the electron), the wake is similar to that in a preformed plasma.  \n Energy measurement. The energy spectrometer consists of a dipole magnet that disperses the electrons vertically according to their momentum $\\boldsymbol { p }$ . The dispersion can be closely approximated by a deflection at the centre of the magnet: $\\theta _ { 1 } = e \\int B \\mathrm { d } L / p$ . Using the measured dispersion, its integrated magnetic flux density #BdL was calculated to be $1 . 2 \\mathrm { T m }$ . In general, all particles in a pulse leave the plasma from a well-defined spot, but with a non-negligible exit angle $\\theta _ { 0 }$ . To discriminate between a vertical exit angle and the deflection by the magnet, the particle distribution is measured at two planes, $8 6 \\mathrm { c m }$ and $1 8 6 \\mathrm { c m }$ downstream of the centre of the dipole (Fig. 1).  \n At each of the two planes, the particle distribution is measured by imaging Cherenkov radiation emitted as the electrons pass through a $1 5 \\mathrm { - m m }$ -wide air gap established by two silicon wafers (not shown in Fig. 1), positioned at an angle of $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ to the beam. The second wafer acts as a mirror and deflects the Cherenkov light into a lens that images the origin of the light onto a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CCD). The electrons pass the silicon almost unperturbed.  \n A system of equations is set up relating the offsets at the two planes to two angles, the exit angle at the plasma $\\theta _ { 0 }$ and the deflection angle in the magnet $\\theta _ { 1 }$ (see Fig. 1). For each feature in the spectrum that can be identified on both screens, for instance scalloping of the beam shown in Fig. 2a, this system of equations has been solved for $\\theta _ { 0 }$ and $\\theta _ { 1 }$ , the latter angle giving the particle energy. The highest-energy feature that can clearly be resolved (see Fig. 2a) is used to determine the energy gain for this event. The uncertainty in the energy measurement is dominated by the uncertainty in the determination of the position of this feature.  \n The images have been corrected at the level of a few per cent for the nonuniform collection efficiency of the optics. Pixel-to-pixel variations in the CCD offset and a common mode have been subtracted; the signal from X-rays that hit the CCD directly has been eliminated.  \n Simulations. The simulations were done using the quasi-static, three-dimensional, particle-in-cell code called QuickPIC. The three-dimensional computational grid forms a box xy $z ( 2 4 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\times 2 4 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\times 2 6 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ in size whose axial coordinate is z-ct. Therefore, the simulation window moves at the speed of light, which is very close to the beam speed in the $z$ direction. The number of grid points is $2 5 6 \\times 2 5 6 \\times 5 1 2$ respectively. The beam is initialized so that in vacuum, it would focus $1 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ beyond the start of the lithium vapour with a $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ root-mean-square spot size. The longitudinal current profile is extracted from the unique LiTrack simulation that matches the experimentally measured beam spectrum produced by the SLAC accelerator. The resulting current profile approximates a gaussian $( \\sigma _ { z } \\approx 1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ with a small tail. We use 8.4 million particles for the beam and $2 . 6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ particles for each ‘slice’ of lithium. In the quasi-static approximation, as the entire beam moves through a slice of gas, the lithium ionizes, the resulting plasma evolves transversely and, to account for the axial motion, the charge on each particle is suitably changed. The resulting plasma forces are stored for each slice and are then used to advance the momentum and position of each beam electron. The beam electrons are advanced every $1 . 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , which is 1/26th of a betatron wavelength for 42 GeV electrons in the flat density region. The simulations were done on the Apple X-serve Dawson Cluster at UCLA.  \n  \n Received 21 July; accepted 13 December 2006.  \n 1. Tajima, T. & Dawson, J. M. Laser electron accelerator. Phys. Rev.

INTRODUCTION  \n Dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) provides highest gradients among nonplasma accelerators. In 2013, the acceleration of relativistic electrons was demonstrated at SLAC with a gradient of more than $2 5 0 \\mathrm { M e V } / \\mathrm { m }$ [1], which was recently increased to $6 9 0 ~ \\mathrm { M e V / m }$ [2]. Low energy electrons $( 2 7 . 7 \\ \\mathrm { k e V } )$ were accelerated by the group in Erlangen [3] with a gradient of $2 5 \\mathrm { \\ : M e V / m }$ using a single grating structure. The group at Stanford University used a dual pillar structure to accelerate $9 6 ~ \\mathrm { k e V }$ electrons with a gradient of more than $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M e V / m }$ [4]. In principle, the gradient of a DLA is only limited by the structure damage threshold fluence, which is roughly two orders of magnitude higher for dielectrics than for metals. The reason for the rediscovery of this rather old concept of inverse SmithPurcell or inverse Cherenkov effects for particle acceleration (see, e.g., [5]) is that nowadays both the ultrashort laser pulse control techniques as well as the nano-fabrication have significantly improved. Summaries of the recent developments can be found in [6,7].  \n Although the experimentally demonstrated gradients in DLA structures are very promising, there are still crucial challenges to create a miniaturized DLA-based particle accelerator. So far the experimentally achieved gradients could only be used to increase the beam’s energy spread and not for coherent acceleration. Moreover, the interaction length with present DLA structures is limited to the Rayleigh range (see Appendix) of the incident electron beam. For low energy electrons, due to the high gradient, the acceleration defocusing even leads to interaction distances significantly shorter than the Rayleigh range.  \n  \n Thus, in order to use DLA for a real accelerator, focusing schemes have to be developed. One option would be alternating phase focusing (APF) as outlined in Fig. 1. Here, drift sections between grating cells lead to jumps in the synchronous phase, which can be designed to provide net focusing. Such schemes can be a way to increase the interaction length in DLAs and make an accelerator on a microchip feasible.  \n A challenge in the creation of a DLA based optical accelerator is related to the complex 3D beam dynamics in DLA structures, which has not been treated systematically in the existing literature yet. In order to facilitate front to end simulations and identify optimized DLA structures, we employ a simple and efficient numerical tracking scheme, which does not require a large amount of computing power, it runs in MATLAB [8] on an ordinary PC.  \n  \n Due to the periodicity of a DLA grating, only one spatial Fourier harmonic contributes to the kick of the beam. In a simplified approach, where fringe fields are neglected, the entire laser field can be represented by a set of such Fourier coefficients, where only one complex number represents each grating cell. By means of the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [9], this single complex number also allows to determine the transverse kicks experienced by a particle while traveling through one grating period.  \n When the three-dimensional kicks are applied to the beam particles in a symplectic scheme (we use symplectic Euler, which is equivalent to Leap Frog) the tracking becomes phase space volume preserving. Thus, with no numerical (artificial) emittance increase, the physical emittance increase due to the nonlinear fields in the DLA interaction can be calculated. Moreover, since the equations of motion are coupled, there is also emittance exchange between the different planes which can be analyzed.  \n In the present study we neglect all intensity dependent effects as space charge, wakes, and radiation emission. The number of particles is chosen such that smooth spectra are obtained, a reasonable value is $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ , at which the computational time is about one second per grating cell.  \n With no loss of generality, we restrict ourselves to symmetric grating structures driven from both lateral sides. This makes sure that the axis of symmetry is in the center and the fields have a cosh profile. In the case of nonsymmetric structures or nonsymmetric driving, the fields will have an exponential or an off-axis cosh profile. However, single driver systems can be combined with Bragg mirrors in order to obtain a good approximation to an on-axis cosh profile with a single side driver (see again Fig. 1). Another option is to reshape the structure as e.g., presented in [4], or, just to accept the asymmetry which then leads to a smaller effective aperture. Furthermore, we restrict ourselves to linear dielectrics. Driving the dielectric into its nonlinear regime is discussed in [10] (experimental), whereas the theoretical reader [11] particularly covers quantum aspects of high fields.  \n As it is usually done, e.g., for the synchrotron motion in ion synchrotrons, we take the limit from the tracking difference equations to differential equations. Since the three-dimensional kick must be irrotational due to the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem, it can be derived from a scalar potential. This potential directly allows to determine the 6D Hamiltonian which completely describes the single particle dynamics analytically.  \n Both the numerical and the analytical approach can be generalized from ordinary DLA gratings to tilted DLA gratings, which have been proposed as deflectors or laser driven undulators [12–14]. Such a grating is depicted in Fig. 2. However, since our code does not include the radiation fields, a dedicated code as, e.g., [15] can be used to treat the dynamics self-consistently. The analytical kicks reported here can serve as input quantities. Our approach aims at maximal simplicity such that studies of fundamental questions, as, e.g., transverse focusing and deflection, are quickly possible.  \n  \n The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the determination of the longitudinal and transverse fields and kicks in a single grating period. Here we use CST Studio Suite [16] to calculate the longitudinal kick at the center of the structure. The dependence on the transverse coordinates as well as the transverse kicks are modeled analytically. In Sec. III we present a symplectic 6D tracking method based on one kick per grating period. Analytical descriptions of the coupled longitudinal and transverse beam dynamics as well as the full 6D Hamiltonian are given in Sec. IV. Simplifications and beam matching in linearized fields are also discussed in this section. In Sec. V we address the three crucial examples: subrelativistic acceleration, relativistic acceleration, and deflection by means of DLA gratings. The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook to DLA focusing channels in Sec. VI.  \n II. FIELDS AND KICKS IN PERIODIC STRUCTURES  \n Usual particle tracking algorithms solve Maxwell’s equations with a predefined time step. Instead of that, we make use of the periodicity of the structure and apply only the kicks which are known not to average out a priori. The other field harmonics are neglected. The validity of this neglect depends on the effect of transients which is effectively suppressed when the structure period is matched to the beam velocity. With no loss of generality we restrict ourselves here to an infrared laser with $\\lambda _ { 0 } = 1 . 9 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and structures made of Silicon $\\left( \\varepsilon _ { r } = 1 1 . 6 3 \\right)$ . A single cell of a symmetrically driven Bragg mirror cavity structure is shown in Fig. 3.  \n A. Analysis of the longitudinal field  \n A coordinate system is applied such that the electron beam propagates in positive $\\mathbf { \\delta } _ { Z } .$ -direction and the $\\mathbf { Z }$ -polarized laser propagates in y-direction. The unit cell of a periodic dielectric structure has dimensions $\\lambda _ { g x }$ and $\\lambda _ { g z }$ . In order to where the underlined electric field is a phasor at the fixed frequency $\\omega = 2 \\pi c / \\lambda _ { 0 }$ of the laser, and $q$ is the charge $( q = - e$ for electrons). The variable $s$ denotes the relative position of the particle behind an arbitrarily defined reference particle moving at $z = v t$ . Thus $z$ is the absolute position in the laboratory frame, while $s$ denotes the phase shift with respect to $z$ . Due to the $z$ -periodicity, the laser field can be expanded in spatial Fourier series  \n  \n allow the laser field to escape the structure, open boundaries in positive and negative y-direction are assumed. The energy gain of a particle in one cell is  \n $$\n\\underline { { E _ { z } } } ( x , y , z ) = \\sum _ { m = - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) e ^ { - i m \\frac { 2 \\pi } { \\lambda _ { g z } } z }\n$$ \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } {  { \\Delta W ( x , y ; s ) = q \\int _ { - \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 } ^ { \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 } E _ { z } ( x , y , z ; t = ( z + s ) / v ) \\mathrm { d } z } } \\\\ & { } & \\\\ & { } & { = q \\int _ { - \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 } ^ { \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 } \\mathrm { R e } \\{ \\underline { { E } } _ { z } ( x , y , z ) e ^ { i \\omega ( z + s ) / v } \\} \\mathrm { d } z , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n $$\n\\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) = \\frac { 1 } { \\lambda _ { g z } } \\int _ { - \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 } ^ { \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 } \\underline { { E } } _ { z } ( x , y , z ) e ^ { i m \\frac { 2 \\pi } { \\lambda _ { g z } } z } \\mathrm { d } z ,\n$$ \n which allows us to compute the energy gain integral [Eq. (2)] as  \n $$\n\\Delta W ( x , y ; s ) = q \\mathrm { R e } \\biggl [ e ^ { \\frac { 2 \\pi i s } { \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } } } \\sum _ { m = - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) \\lambda _ { g z } \\mathrm { s i n c } \\biggl ( \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } } - m \\biggr ) \\biggr ] ,\n$$ \n where $\\operatorname { s i n c } ( \\cdot ) = \\sin ( \\pi \\cdot ) / ( \\pi \\cdot )$ . The electric field phasor and its spatial Fourier coefficients for the structure in Fig. 3 are plotted in Fig. 4. It has a small real part, which is coincidental, and a strong first and weak second harmonic. If the round braces in Eq. (5) is non-integer, the energy gain averages to zero, if it is integer other than zero, it directly vanishes. Thus we have the phase synchronicity condition  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { g z } = m \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 }\n$$ \n and the particle’s energy gain simplifies to  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle \\Delta W ( x , y ; s ) = q \\lambda _ { g z } \\mathrm { R e } \\{ e ^ { 2 \\pi i \\frac { s } { \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } } } \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) \\} } \\\\ { = q \\lambda _ { g z } | \\underline { { e } } _ { m } | \\cos { \\bigg ( 2 \\pi \\frac { s } { \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } } + \\varphi _ { m } \\bigg ) } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $\\varphi _ { m } =$ arctan $\\mathrm { I m } \\{ \\underline { { e } } _ { m } \\} / \\mathrm { R e } \\{ \\underline { { e } } _ { m } \\}$ is the phase of the Fourier coefficient. The energy gain is maximal at sopt ¼ $- \\varphi _ { m } \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } / 2 \\pi$ for positively charged particles and $s _ { \\mathrm { o p t } } =$ $- ( \\varphi _ { m } + \\pi ) \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } / 2 \\pi$ for electrons. Zero acceleration is found at $s _ { 0 } = - ( \\varphi _ { m } \\pm \\pi / 2 ) \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } / 2 \\pi$ , where all these expressions are to be taken modulo $\\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } / m$ . The integer spatial harmonic $m$ has the same meaning as the harmonic number in conventional accelerators, i.e., the number of buckets per grating period and Eq. (6) resembles the Wideroe condition.  \n As shown in Eq. (5), the higher nonsynchronous harmonics average out. It can be shown, that their second order (ponderomotive) contribution is also small. However, the lower non-synchronous (sub-) harmonics can provide ponderomotive focusing, as discussed in [17]. In our code, they can be represented by modifying the synchronous Fourier coefficient $\\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } ( n )$ along the grating cells $n$ , which however is beyond the scope of this paper.  \n For subrelativistic accelerators, the grating needs to be chirped in period length in order to always fulfill Eq. (6) on the energy ramp. The change of period length is given by the energy velocity differential  \n $$\n\\frac { \\Delta z } { \\lambda _ { g z } } = \\frac { 1 } { \\beta ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\frac { \\Delta W } { W }\n$$ \n and is in the range of ${ \\lesssim } 1 \\%$ for $W _ { \\mathrm { k i n } } = 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { k e V }$ and $\\Delta W / \\lambda _ { g z } = 1 \\mathrm { G e V / m }$ . The thus created “quasiperiodic\" gratings can be seen in good approximation as periodic, however, phase drifts have to be compensated in the structure design [18].  \n B. Analysis of the transverse field  \n The transverse field probed by a rigidly moving charge can be obtained using the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [9], which holds for either vanishing fields at infinity or periodic boundary conditions as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\nabla ^ { \\prime } \\times \\Delta \\vec { p } ( \\vec { r } _ { \\perp } , s ) = \\displaystyle \\int _ { - T / 2 } ^ { T / 2 } \\mathrm { d } t [ \\nabla \\times \\vec { F } ( \\vec { r } _ { \\perp } , z , t ) ] _ { z = v t - s } } \\\\ { = \\vec { B } | _ { - T / 2 } ^ { T / 2 } = 0 . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Here the “relative gradient” is defined as $\\nabla ^ { \\prime } =$ $( \\partial _ { x } , \\partial _ { y } , - \\partial _ { s } ) ^ { \\mathrm { ~ T ~ } }$ and $\\lambda _ { g z } = \\beta c T$ . The transverse kick per cell can be written as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } & { } & { \\Delta \\vec { p } _ { \\perp } ( x , y ; s ) = - \\displaystyle \\int \\mathrm { d } s \\nabla _ { \\perp } \\Delta p _ { \\parallel } ( x , y ; s ) } \\\\ & { } & { \\quad = - \\displaystyle \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { 2 \\pi m } q \\frac { 1 } { \\beta c } \\nabla _ { \\perp } \\int _ { - \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 } ^ { \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 } \\mathrm { I m } \\{ \\underline { { E } } _ { z } ( x , y , z ) e ^ { i \\omega ( z + s ) / \\upsilon } \\} \\mathrm { d } z , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where the energy momentum differential $\\Delta p _ { \\| } = \\Delta W / ( \\beta c )$ was applied. Moreover, if the phase-synchronicity condition [Eq. (6)] is fulfilled, the kick becomes  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle \\Delta \\vec { p } _ { \\perp } ( x , y ; s ) = - \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } ^ { 2 } } { 2 \\pi m } q \\frac { 1 } { \\beta c } \\nabla _ { \\perp } \\mathrm { I m } \\{ e ^ { 2 \\pi i \\frac { s } { \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } } } \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) \\} } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle \\ = - \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { m } q \\frac { 1 } { \\beta c } \\mathrm { I m } \\{ e ^ { 2 \\pi i \\frac { s } { \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } } } \\underline { { \\vec { f } } } _ { m } ( x , y ) \\} , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $\\underline { { \\vec { f } } } _ { m } ( x , y ) = \\lambda _ { g z } \\nabla _ { \\perp } \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) / 2 \\pi$ . In the following, the structure under investigation is generalized to a tilted grating as visible in Fig. 5, which reproduces the ordinary grating for tilt angle $\\alpha = 0$ . The tilted grating is periodic in $z$ and $x$ direction. Thus for any function $F ( x , y , s )$ must hold  \n $$\n\\frac { \\partial F } { \\partial x } = \\frac { \\partial F } { \\partial s } \\frac { \\partial s } { \\partial z } \\frac { \\partial z } { \\partial x } = \\frac { \\partial F } { \\partial s } \\tan \\alpha .\n$$ \n The $s$ -derivative can be calculated in the Fourier representation by Eq. (7) as  \n $$\n\\frac { \\partial \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) } { \\partial x } = \\tan \\alpha \\frac { 2 \\pi i } { \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } } \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) .\n$$ \n The derivatives in $y$ -direction can be determined by the dispersion relation for the synchronous mode. We have  \n $$\nk _ { z } = \\frac { \\omega } { \\beta c } , ~ k _ { x } = \\frac { 2 \\pi } { \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 } } \\tan { \\alpha } ~ \\mathrm { a n d } ~ k = \\frac { \\omega } { c }\n$$ \n and thus  \n $$\nk _ { y } = \\pm \\sqrt { k ^ { 2 } - ( k _ { z } ^ { 2 } + k _ { x } ^ { 2 } ) } = \\pm \\frac { \\omega } { c } \\sqrt { 1 - \\frac { 1 } { \\beta ^ { 2 } } ( 1 + \\tan ^ { 2 } \\alpha ) } .\n$$ \n For a nontilt grating $( \\alpha = 0 )$ ) this is the well-known evanescent decay of the near field $k _ { y } = i \\omega / ( \\beta \\gamma c )$ . Once $k _ { x } , k _ { y }$ are determined, the fields can be found from  \n $$\n\\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x , y ) = \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( 0 , 0 ) \\cosh ( i k _ { y } y ) e ^ { i k _ { x } x } ,\n$$ \n where $\\lambda _ { g x } = \\lambda _ { g z } /$ tan $\\alpha$ .  \n A map of the energy gain and transverse kicks for the grating in Fig. 6 can be seen in Fig. 7 for a grating tilt angle $\\alpha = 3 0$ deg. The results labeled numerical are obtained by line integration [Eq. (7)] of the electric field simulated with CST MWS [16] and the analytical results correspond to Eq. (18). The transverse kicks are obtained by Eq. (13) as  \n  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } {  { \\vec { \\underline { { f } } } _ { m } ( x , y ) = \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( 0 , 0 ) \\cosh ( i k _ { y } y ) e ^ { i k _ { x } x } i m \\tan \\alpha \\vec { e } _ { x } } } \\\\ & { } & { + \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( 0 , 0 ) \\sinh ( i k _ { y } y ) e ^ { i k _ { x } x } ( i k _ { y } \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 \\pi ) \\vec { e } _ { y } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n and are depicted as arrows in Fig. 7. For the numerical results, the gradient is determined by finite differences in MATLAB [8]. Note that $- i k _ { y } \\in \\mathbb { R } ^ { + }$ , i.e., the kick in $x$ -direction is in phase with the acceleration while the kick in $y$ -direction is 90 degrees shifted.  \n For a particle that is only slightly displaced from the beam axis by $\\Delta \\vec { x } = ( \\Delta x , \\Delta y )$ , the kick can be written as two-dimensional Taylor expansion  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle \\vec { \\underline { { f } } } _ { m } ( x , y ) = \\vec { \\underline { { f } } } _ { m } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } ) + ( \\nabla _ { \\perp } \\underline { { \\vec { f } } } _ { m } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } ) ) \\Delta \\vec { x } + O ( | | \\Delta \\vec { x } | | ^ { 2 } ) } \\\\ { \\displaystyle = \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { 2 \\pi } ( \\nabla _ { \\perp } \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } ) } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\quad \\quad + ( \\nabla _ { \\perp } \\nabla _ { \\perp } ^ { \\mathrm { T } } ) \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } ) \\Delta \\vec { x } ) + O ( | | \\Delta \\vec { x } | | ^ { 2 } ) , \\quad ( 2 0 } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where  \n $$\n\\nabla _ { \\perp } \\nabla _ { \\perp } ^ { \\mathrm { T } } = \\left( { \\begin{array} { c c } { \\partial _ { x } ^ { 2 } } & { \\partial _ { x } \\partial _ { y } } \\\\ { \\partial _ { y } \\partial _ { x } } & { \\partial _ { y } ^ { 2 } } \\end{array} } \\right)\n$$ \n is the Hessian. The expansion Eq. (20) about $x _ { 0 } = 0$ , $y _ { 0 } = 0$ of Eq. (18) results in  \n $$\n\\underline { { \\vec { f } } } _ { m } ( \\Delta x , \\Delta y ) = \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { 2 \\pi } \\underline { { e } } _ { m } ( 0 , 0 ) \\binom { i k _ { x } - k _ { x } ^ { 2 } \\Delta x } { - k _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\Delta y } ,\n$$ \n i.e., a position independent (coherent) kick component in $x$ -direction, vanishing for $\\alpha = 0$ . Using this abstract derivation, the results of several papers proposing DLA undulators [12–14] can be recovered.  \n III. TRACKING EQUATIONS  \n In order to study the motion of particles in the fields of periodic gratings we approximate the forces by one kick per grating period and track with the symplectic Euler method. In spite of the very high gradients in DLA structures, the energy can still be seen as an adiabatic variable, as it is the case in conventional linacs. Tracking the full time dependence of γ, as required for example in plasma accelerators, can be avoided due to the shortness of the periods. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to $m = 1$ from this point and introduce normalized variables in the paraxial approximation  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c c c } { { x ^ { \\prime } = \\displaystyle \\frac { p _ { x } } { p _ { z 0 } } , } } & { { \\Delta x ^ { \\prime } = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\Delta p _ { x } ( x , \\mathbf { y } , \\varphi ) } { p _ { z 0 } } , } } & { { } } \\\\ { { y ^ { \\prime } = \\displaystyle \\frac { p _ { y } } { p _ { z 0 } } , } } & { { \\Delta y ^ { \\prime } = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\Delta p _ { y } ( x , \\mathbf { y } , \\varphi ) } { p _ { z 0 } } , } } & { { } } \\\\ { { \\varphi = 2 \\pi \\displaystyle \\frac { s } { \\lambda _ { g z } } , } } & { { \\delta = \\displaystyle \\frac { W - W _ { 0 } } { W _ { 0 } } , } } & { { } } \\\\ { { \\Delta \\delta = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\Delta W ( x , \\mathbf { y } , \\varphi ) - \\Delta W ( 0 , 0 , \\varphi _ { s } ) } { W _ { 0 } } , } } & { { } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $W _ { 0 } = \\gamma m _ { e } c ^ { 2 }$ and $p _ { z 0 } = \\beta \\gamma m _ { e } c$ . The particle at the synchronous phase $\\varphi _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ has $\\Delta \\delta = 0$ , i.e., its energy gain is entirely described by the acceleration ramp. The energy gain $\\Delta W$ is given by Eq. (7) and thus the energy gain of the synchronous particle is  \n $$\n\\Delta W ( 0 , 0 , \\varphi _ { \\mathrm { s } } ) = q \\lambda _ { g z } \\mathrm { R e } \\{ e ^ { i \\varphi _ { \\mathrm { s } } } \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } \\} ,\n$$ \n where we write $e _ { 1 } = \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } ( x = 0 , y = 0 )$ for brevity. Note that the synchronous phase and the phase of each  \n particle always refer to the laser phase. The sum of the kicks  \n $$\nW ( N ) = W _ { \\mathrm { i n i t } } + \\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } \\Delta W ^ { ( n ) } ( 0 , 0 , \\varphi _ { \\mathrm { s } } ^ { ( n ) } )\n$$ \n describes the acceleration ramp, where the synchronous phase $\\varphi _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ can be chosen arbitrarily in each grating cell. The variables $e _ { 1 } , \\lambda _ { g z } , W _ { 0 } , \\beta , \\gamma , \\varphi _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ and all variables in Eq. (24) are stored as arrays indexed by the grating cell number. The kicks are obtained using Eqs. (7), (18), (19), and (13) and read  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\Delta x ^ { \\prime } = - \\displaystyle \\frac { q \\lambda _ { 0 } } { p _ { z 0 } c } \\tan ( \\alpha ) \\cosh ( i k _ { y } y ) \\mathrm { R e } \\{ \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } e ^ { i \\varphi + i \\frac { 2 \\pi x } { \\lambda _ { g x } } } \\} } \\\\ & { \\Delta y ^ { \\prime } = \\displaystyle \\frac { - i k _ { y } \\lambda _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } q \\beta } { 2 \\pi p _ { z 0 } c } \\mathrm { s i n h } ( i k _ { y } y ) \\mathrm { I m } \\{ \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } e ^ { i \\varphi + i \\frac { 2 \\pi x } { \\lambda _ { g x } } } \\} } \\\\ & { \\Delta \\delta = \\displaystyle \\frac { q \\lambda _ { g z } } { \\gamma m _ { e } c ^ { 2 } } \\mathrm { R e } \\{ \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } ( \\mathrm { c o s h } ( i k _ { y } y ) e ^ { i \\varphi + i \\frac { 2 \\pi x } { \\lambda _ { g x } } } - e ^ { i \\varphi _ { s } } ) \\} , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $k _ { \\mathrm { y } }$ is given by Eq. (17). The tracking equations are  \n where an explicit scheme is obtained by applying first the “kicks” and then the “pushes”. The adiabatic damping in the transverse planes is described by  \n $$\nA ^ { ( n ) } = \\frac { ( \\beta \\gamma ) ^ { ( n + 1 ) } } { ( \\beta \\gamma ) ^ { ( n ) } } = 1 + \\bigg [ \\frac { \\lambda _ { 0 } q \\mathrm { R e } \\{ e ^ { i \\varphi _ { s } } \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } \\} } { \\beta \\gamma m _ { e } c ^ { 2 } } \\bigg ] ^ { ( n ) } .\n$$ \n Symplecticity of the scheme is confirmed by calculating  \n $$\n\\operatorname* { d e t } \\frac { \\partial ( x , x ^ { \\prime } , y , y ^ { \\prime } , \\varphi , \\delta ) ^ { ( n + 1 ) } } { \\partial ( x , x ^ { \\prime } , y , y ^ { \\prime } , \\varphi , \\delta ) ^ { ( n ) } } = A ^ { ( n ) 2 } ,\n$$ \n which holds independently of the realization of the kick functions $\\Delta x ^ { \\prime } ( x , y , \\varphi )$ , $\\Delta y ^ { \\prime } ( x , y , \\varphi )$ and $\\Delta \\delta ( x , y , \\varphi )$ . Equations (27) contain the full nonlinear kicks which cannot be linearized, since the usual bunch lengths and widths are not significantly smaller than the grating periods and apertures. However, in the idealized case of extremely small bunches, linearization results in a scheme equivalent to one linear R-matrix transformation per grating period.  \n Relevant information about the particle ensemble moving in space is given by statistical quantities such as envelope and emittance, which can be derived from the beam matrix (second order moment matrix) as function of the period number. We define the 6D coordinate vector as  \n $$\n\\vec { r } = ( x , p _ { x } , y , p _ { y } , \\Delta s , \\Delta P _ { z } ) ^ { T } ,\n$$ \n where $\\Delta s = ( \\varphi - \\varphi _ { s } ) \\lambda _ { g z } / 2 \\pi$ and $\\Delta P _ { z } { = } \\Delta p _ { z } / \\gamma { = } W _ { 0 } / ( \\beta c \\gamma ) \\delta$ . The symmetric and positive definite beam matrix reads  \n $$\n\\mathbf { M } = \\langle \\vec { r } \\vec { r } ^ { T } \\rangle ,\n$$ \n where the average is taken component-wise. In the absence of nonlinearities, particular emittances are conserved. That is in the case of coupling only the 6D emittance given by  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { 6 D } = \\sqrt { \\operatorname* { d e t } { \\bf M } } .\n$$ \n In case of decoupled planes, the determinants of the diagonal blocks (the emittances of the respective plane) are conserved individually. They read  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle \\varepsilon _ { x , n } = \\frac { 1 } { m _ { e } c } \\sqrt { \\operatorname* { d e t } \\mathbf { M } _ { 1 } } , } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\varepsilon _ { y , n } = \\frac { 1 } { m _ { e } c } \\sqrt { \\operatorname* { d e t } \\mathbf { M } _ { 2 } } , } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\varepsilon _ { z , n } = \\frac { 1 } { e } \\sqrt { \\operatorname* { d e t } \\mathbf { M } _ { 3 } } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n in the usual units of $\\textrm { m }$ rad and eVs, respectively. The analysis of emittance coupling by means of the eigen-emittances  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { e i g } , i } = \\mathrm { e i g s } ( \\mathbf { J } \\mathbf { M } ) ,\n$$ \n where $\\mathbf { J }$ is the symplectic matrix, is also possible with our code, however beyond the scope of this paper.  \n IV. CONTINUOUS EQUATIONS OF MOTION  \n In order to address the continuous motion in DLA structures we employ positions and momentum as canonically conjugate variables in all directions. The transformation for the energy is $\\Delta p _ { z } = \\Delta W / ( \\beta c )$ . We address the flat and the tilted grating separately and assume for simplicity $\\lvert \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } \\rvert$ to be constant for all cells and $\\arg ( \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } ) = 0$ .  \n A. Flat grating  \n Hamilton’s equations can be written as  \n $$\n\\dot { x } = \\frac { p _ { x } } { m _ { e } \\gamma }\n$$ \n $$\n\\dot { p } _ { x } = 0\n$$ \n $$\n\\dot { y } = \\frac { p _ { y } } { m _ { e } \\gamma }\n$$ \n $$\n\\dot { p } _ { y } = - q e _ { 1 } \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { 2 \\pi } \\frac { \\omega } { \\beta \\gamma c } \\sinh \\left( \\frac { \\omega y } { \\beta \\gamma c } \\right) \\sin \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g z } } \\right)\n$$ \n $$\n\\dot { s } = \\frac { \\Delta p _ { z } } { m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } }\n$$ \n $$\n\\dot { \\Delta p _ { z } } = q e _ { 1 } \\left[ \\cosh \\left( \\frac { \\omega y } { \\beta \\gamma c } \\right) \\cos \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g z } } \\right) - \\cos \\varphi _ { s } \\right] .\n$$ \n Due to Eq. (9) the force field is irrotational and can be derived from a potential as ${ \\vec { F } } = - \\nabla ^ { \\prime } V$ , where integration yields  \n $$\nV = q e _ { 1 } \\left[ \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { 2 \\pi } \\cosh \\left( \\frac { \\omega y } { \\beta \\gamma c } \\right) \\sin \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g z } } \\right) - s \\cos \\varphi _ { s } \\right] .\n$$ \n This potential and its adiabatic change with $\\beta$ is illustrated in Fig. 8. The full 6D Hamiltonian reads  \n $$\nH = \\frac { 1 } { 2 m _ { e } \\gamma } ( p _ { x } ^ { 2 } + p _ { y } ^ { 2 } + \\Delta P _ { z } ^ { 2 } ) + V ,\n$$ \n where $\\Delta p _ { z } / \\gamma$ was replaced with $\\Delta P _ { z }$ . The coupled equations of motion are  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\ddot { x } = 0 } \\\\ & { \\ddot { y } = - \\frac { q e _ { 1 } } { m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\mathrm { s i n h } \\Bigg ( \\frac { \\omega y } { \\beta \\gamma c } \\Bigg ) \\mathrm { s i n } \\Bigg ( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g z } } \\Bigg ) } \\\\ & { \\ddot { s } = \\frac { q e _ { 1 } } { m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } } \\Bigg ( \\mathrm { c o s h } \\Bigg ( \\frac { \\omega y } { \\beta \\gamma c } \\Bigg ) \\mathrm { c o s } \\Bigg ( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g z } } \\Bigg ) - \\mathrm { c o s } \\varphi _ { s } \\Bigg ) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n If the beam size is significantly smaller than the aperture $( y \\ll \\beta \\gamma c / \\omega )$ , the longitudinal equation decouples and becomes the ordinary differential equation of synchrotron motion. The transverse motion becomes linear in this case, however still dependent on the longitudinal motion via $\\varphi$ . The equation of motion,  \n $$\n\\ddot { y } = \\frac { - q e _ { 1 } \\omega } { m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } \\beta c } \\sin ( \\varphi ) y ,\n$$ \n is Hill’s equation, with the synchrotron angle being the focusing function. However there is a crucial difference to ordinary magnetic focusing channels. The focusing force scales as $\\gamma ^ { - 3 }$ as expected for acceleration defocusing [19], rather than with $\\gamma ^ { - 1 }$ as would be expected for a magnetic quadrupole focusing channel. The solution to Eq. (39) as function of $z$ for fixed $s = \\lambda _ { g z } \\varphi _ { s } / 2 \\pi$ , i.e., when the bunch length is significantly shorter than the period length, is  \n $$\ny = y _ { 0 } \\exp \\left( \\sqrt { \\frac { - q e _ { 1 } \\omega } { m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } \\beta ^ { 3 } c ^ { 3 } } \\sin \\varphi _ { s } z } \\right)\n$$ \n and a synchronous particle with nonzero transverse offset is expected to grow to double transverse amplitude in  \n $$\nL _ { 2 } = \\frac { \\ln 2 } { \\sqrt { \\frac { - q e _ { 1 } \\omega } { m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } \\beta ^ { 3 } c ^ { 3 } } \\sin \\varphi _ { s } } } .\n$$ \n For subrelativistic particles $L _ { 2 }$ can reach down to a few micron. However, longer interaction lengths can be achieved by focusing the beam into the DLA structure externally.  \n As shown in Fig. 9, the phase ranges of longitudinal and transverse focusing are disjoint. This is a consequence of Earnshaw’s theorem [20] which can be directly observed in Eq. (36), i.e., V has no minima but only saddle points. Similarly as in Paul traps (see, e.g., [21]), stable motion in both the y- and $z$ -planes can only be achieved by rotating the saddle. For an accelerator this means alternating the synchronous phase. This so called alternating-phasefocusing (APF) scheme has been developed for ion rf linacs already in the 1950s (e.g., [22]) but later rejected in favor of the RFQ [19].  \n For an adiabatic Hamiltonian and if stable orbits exist, a matched locally Gaussian distribution is given by  \n $$\nf = C e ^ { - H / \\langle H \\rangle }\n$$ \n and a locally elliptic (Hofmann-Pedersen [23]) matched distribution is given by  \n $$\nf = C { \\sqrt { H _ { \\operatorname* { m a x } } - H } } .\n$$ \n The normalization constant $C$ is determined by integration. Note that in the case of nonperiodic motion $f$ will not be integrable. Thus, we can only write a matched distribution for the longitudinal plane if $\\varphi _ { s } \\in [ \\pi / 2 , \\pi ]$ and for the transverse plane if $\\varphi _ { s } \\in [ \\pi , 3 / 2 \\pi ]$ .  \n The Hamiltonian is not time independent, however its dependence on $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ is adiabatic. Thus, if $\\varphi _ { s }$ is changing at most adiabatically, the distribution will deform such that the emittance increase is bounded, i.e., also the emittance remains an adiabatic invariant. First, we consider the longitudinal plane and linearized fields. For a given bunch length $\\sigma _ { \\Delta s }$ the matched energy spread is  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { \\Delta W } = \\frac { c _ { 0 } } { \\lambda _ { 0 } } \\sqrt { - 2 \\pi \\lambda _ { g z } m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } q e _ { 1 } \\sin \\varphi _ { s } } \\sigma _ { \\Delta s } .\n$$ \n For a slow change of the potential and filling the bucket only up to a small fraction, the phase space area given by $\\pi \\sigma _ { \\Delta \\varphi } \\sigma _ { \\Delta W }$ is conserved. Moreover, using Eq. (44) a normalized bunch length and energy spread can be written as [19]  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle \\sigma _ { \\Delta W , n } = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt [ 4 ] { \\beta ^ { 3 } \\gamma ^ { 3 } } } \\sigma _ { \\Delta _ { W } } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\sigma _ { \\Delta \\varphi , n } = \\sqrt [ 4 ] { \\beta ^ { 3 } \\gamma ^ { 3 } } \\sigma _ { \\Delta \\varphi } . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Accordingly, in position and momentum coordinates, this reads  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle \\sigma _ { \\Delta P _ { z , n } } = \\sqrt [ 4 ] { \\frac { \\beta } { \\gamma } } \\sigma _ { \\Delta P _ { z } } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\sigma _ { \\Delta s , n } = \\sqrt [ 4 ] { \\frac { \\gamma } { \\beta } } \\sigma _ { \\Delta s } . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Thus the adiabatic phase damping in DLAs behaves in the same way as in rf linacs.  \n As a test of the code, we plot the long time evolution of the longitudinal emittance at zero transverse emittance for 3 different setups in Fig. 10. First, we consider a bunch matched according to Eq. (44) in linearized fields. As expected, the symplectic code preserves the emittance in linear fields. However, the linearly matched bunch shows emittance growth in the non-linear fields. Even stronger emittance increase is to be expected, when there is a mismatch of the bunch length and the energy spread (here we chose $10 \\%$ excess energy spread). The according result is obtained for the y-emittance when setting the synchronous phase into the transverse focusing regime and taking the longitudinal emittance as zero.  \n  \n The effect of adiabatic damping also appears in DLAs in the transverse plane. The linearized transverse Hamiltonian reads  \n $$\nH _ { \\perp } = \\frac { p _ { y } ^ { 2 } } { 2 m _ { e } \\gamma } + \\frac { q e _ { 1 } \\omega \\sin \\varphi _ { s } } { 2 \\beta \\gamma ^ { 2 } c } y ^ { 2 }\n$$ \n and the matched momentum spread is  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { p _ { y } } = \\sqrt { \\frac { m _ { e } q e _ { 1 } \\omega \\sin \\varphi _ { s } } { \\beta \\gamma c } } \\sigma _ { y } .\n$$ \n The area $\\pi \\sigma _ { y } \\sigma _ { p _ { y } }$ is conserved and thus we can write normalized spreads as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { \\sigma _ { y , n } = \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt [ 4 ] { \\beta \\gamma } } \\sigma _ { y } } } \\\\ { { \\sigma _ { p _ { y } , n } = \\sqrt [ 4 ] { \\beta \\gamma } \\sigma _ { p _ { y } } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n One observes, that for increasing beam energy the transverse beam size increases, while the momentum spread decreases. This is in accordance with the potential becoming flatter in the transverse plane, while it becomes steeper in the longitudinal plane for increasing beam energy (cf. Fig. 8).  \n B. Tilted grating  \n The Hamiltonian for the tilted grating is obtained by modifying the potential [Eq. (36)] as  \n $$\nV = q e _ { 1 } \\left[ \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { 2 \\pi } \\mathrm { c o s h } \\left( i k _ { y } y \\right) \\sin \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g z } } + \\frac { 2 \\pi x } { \\lambda _ { g x } } \\right) - s \\cos \\varphi _ { s } \\right] .\n$$ \n The coupled equations of motion are  \n $$\n\\ddot { x } = - \\frac { q e _ { 1 } } { m _ { e } \\gamma } \\frac { \\lambda _ { g z } } { \\lambda _ { g x } } \\cosh \\left( i k _ { y } y \\right) \\cos \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g z } } + \\frac { 2 \\pi x } { \\lambda _ { g x } } \\right)\n$$ \n $$\n\\ddot { y } = \\frac { - i k _ { y } \\lambda _ { g z } q e _ { 1 } } { 2 \\pi m _ { e } \\gamma } \\sinh \\left( i k _ { y } y \\right) \\sin \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g } z } + \\frac { 2 \\pi x } { \\lambda _ { g x } } \\right)\n$$ \n $$\n\\ddot { s } { = } \\frac { q e _ { 1 } } { m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } } \\left[ \\cosh \\left( i k _ { y } y \\right) \\cos \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi s } { \\lambda _ { g } z } { + } \\frac { 2 \\pi x } { \\lambda _ { g x } } \\right) - \\cos \\varphi _ { s } \\right] .\n$$ \n One can observe that a bunch which is not significantly shorter than the grating period is accelerated in both positive and negative $x$ -direction dependent on $s$ . Therefore, a coherent deflection can only be obtained for extremely short bunches. In the following we assume no net acceleration, i.e., $\\varphi _ { s } = \\pi / 2$ , and replace $s =$ $\\lambda _ { 0 } \\varphi _ { s } / 2 \\pi + \\Delta s$ . Since tilted gratings are outlined for the generation of wiggler radiation we restrict ourselves to the ultrarelativistic case $( \\beta \\to 1 )$ ) here. From Eq. (17) one finds $\\pm i k _ { y } = k _ { x } = \\omega / c$ tan $\\alpha$ , which simplifies the potential to  \n $$\nV = q e _ { 1 } \\frac { \\lambda _ { 0 } } { 2 \\pi } \\mathrm { c o s h } \\left( \\frac { \\omega \\tan \\alpha } { c } y \\right) \\cos { \\left[ \\frac { \\omega } { c } ( \\Delta s + x \\tan \\alpha ) \\right] } .\n$$ \n The equations of motion become  \n $$\n{ \\ddot { x } } = { \\frac { q e _ { 1 } } { m _ { e } \\gamma } } \\tan ( \\alpha ) \\cosh \\left[ { \\frac { \\omega \\tan \\alpha } { c } } y \\right] \\sin \\left[ { \\frac { \\omega } { c } } \\left( \\Delta s + x \\tan \\alpha \\right) \\right]\n$$ \n $$\n{ \\ddot { y } } = { \\frac { - i k _ { y } \\lambda _ { g z } q e _ { 1 } } { 2 \\pi m _ { e } \\gamma } } \\sinh \\left[ { \\frac { \\omega \\tan \\alpha } { c } } y \\right] \\cos \\left[ { \\frac { \\omega } { c } } \\left( \\Delta s + x \\tan \\alpha \\right) \\right]\n$$ \n $$\n\\ddot { \\Delta s } = \\frac { q e _ { 1 } } { m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } } \\cosh \\left[ \\frac { \\omega \\tan \\alpha } { c } y \\right] \\sin \\left[ \\frac { \\omega } { c } \\left( \\Delta s + x \\tan \\alpha \\right) \\right] .\n$$ \n Injecting the beam with an offset $x _ { 0 } \\ll \\lambda _ { 0 } / ( 4 \\tan \\alpha )$ results in a coherent oscillation around the $x$ -axis with the longitudinal period  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { u } = \\frac { 2 \\pi c } { \\sqrt { \\frac { - 2 \\pi q e _ { 1 } } { m _ { e } \\gamma \\lambda _ { 0 } } } \\tan \\alpha }\n$$ \n for a particle with $\\Delta s = y = 0$ . In linearized fields, the oscillation amplitude is arbitrary. However, in the nonlinear fields, additionally to the longitudinal plane, we find “buckets” with a distance $\\lambda _ { g x }$ also in the $x$ -plane. These buckets split a ribbon beam which is large in $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -direction into multiple beamlets, where the momentum spread acceptance is maximum at zero and vanishes at $\\lambda _ { g x } / 2$ , where integer multiples of $\\lambda _ { g x }$ can be added.  \n V. APPLICATIONS  \n We apply our approach to similar experimental parameters as for the subrelativistic experiments at FAU Erlangen [3] and the relativistic experiments at SLAC [1,2]. Although the structures are idealized, the results are qualitatively recovered. As a next step, we show modifications and idealizations of the beam parameters, which outline the way to a microchip accelerator.  \n A. Subrelativistic acceleration  \n A subrelativistic DLA structure needs to be chirped in order to always fulfill the synchronicity condition (6) for the synchronous particle. The proper chirp for each cell and the synchronous velocity are obtained by iterating the two equations  \n $$\n\\Delta z ^ { ( n + 1 ) } = \\frac { q e _ { 1 } \\lambda _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \\cos \\varphi _ { s } ^ { ( n ) } } { m _ { e } c ^ { 2 } } \\sqrt { 1 - { \\beta ^ { ( n ) } } ^ { 2 } } \n$$ \n $$\n\\beta ^ { ( n + 1 ) } = \\beta ^ { ( n ) } + \\frac { \\Delta z ^ { ( n + 1 ) } } { \\lambda _ { 0 } } .\n$$ \n The cell length and synchronous energies are  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( n ) } = \\lambda _ { g 0 } + \\sum _ { j = 2 } ^ { n } \\Delta z ^ { ( j - 1 ) }\n$$ \n $$\nW _ { 0 } ^ { ( n ) } = W _ { \\mathrm { i n i t } } + q e _ { 1 } \\sum _ { j = 2 } ^ { n } \\cos \\varphi _ { s } ^ { ( j - 1 ) } \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( j - 1 ) } .\n$$ \n In the following simulations, we assume that the construction of the grating was made such that the cells always fulfill Eq. (57). We start with very low energy electrons $W _ { \\mathrm { k i n } } = 2 7 . 7 \\ \\mathrm { k e V }$ , i.e., $\\beta = 0 . 3 1 6 5$ .  \n For $\\lambda _ { 0 } = 1 . 9 6 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ the initial grating period is $6 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . For simplicity we assume $e _ { 1 } = 1 \\mathrm { G V / m }$ with zero phase for all cells. Aiming for a gradient of $5 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M e V / m }$ , the synchronous phase has to be 120 degree. The ramp according to these parameters is depicted in Fig. 11. Since the electron bunches in the experiments are significantly longer than the grating period, we look at initially unbunched beams with $\\sigma _ { E } = 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { e V }$ .  \n In free space, the full Rayleigh length (cf. Appendix) of the beam with assumed geometric emittance $1 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ at the aperture of $A = 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ is $L _ { R } = A ^ { 2 } / ( 4 \\varepsilon _ { y } ) = 1 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , i.e., about 16 cells. This requires the optimal initial focusing angle of 20 mrad. However, as shown in Fig. 12, in the presence of strong acceleration defocusing forces, the waist appears earlier, i.e., in cell 4.  \n The particle loss and the energy spectrum are plotted in Fig. 13. The spectrum shows clearly that only a fraction of the particles is trapped in the bucket, the particles with $\\delta \\approx - 1 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ are lost, although they do not hit the aperture. The physical loss of particles happens when they reach the aperture in y-direction $\\pm 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m } )$ . The longitudinal bucket capture process is illustrated more clearly for zero transverse emittance in Fig. 14, where no transverse losses appear and a full synchrotron period is displayed.  \n  \n As next step, we take a bunched beam with $\\sigma _ { z } = 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ and a reduced transverse emittance of $\\varepsilon _ { y } = 0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ . As shown in Fig. 15, the waist appears approximately at cell 7, when the beam is strongly focused initially with 45 mrad.  \n Without the acceleration defocusing, the Rayleigh length would be $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ at an initial focusing angle of 2 mrad. The bunch has initially again an energy spread of $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { e V } ;$ which is significantly smaller than the matched energy spread. Thus a coherent quadrupole oscillation appears, which is also visible in the energy spectrum in Fig. 16.  \n B. Relativistic acceleration  \n In this example we take the full aperture to be $A = 8 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ , $\\lambda _ { g } = \\lambda _ { 0 } = 1 . 9 6 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ , $| \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } | = 1 \\ \\mathrm { G V / m }$ , and the number of grating cells is 100. Taking the reference particle on-crest, i.e., $\\varphi _ { s } = \\pi$ , the design ramp is linear with a slope of $1 \\mathrm { G e V / m }$ . The incident electron beam has a bunch length significantly larger than the grating period and is again assumed as unbunched. The kinetic energy is $6 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ and the spread is $\\sigma _ { W } = 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { k e V }$ . The spot size is taken as $\\sigma _ { y } = 4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ and the geometric emittance $\\varepsilon _ { y } = 1 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . The full Rayleigh range is thus $L _ { R } = A ^ { 2 } / ( 4 \\dot { \\varepsilon } _ { y } ) = 1 6 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , which is practically achieved when the beam is focused with 5 mrad into the structure. Figure 17 shows the evolution of the y and $\\mathbf { z }$ phase spaces. The particle loss is monitored in Fig. 18, where the first jump is again the loss at the initial aperture. The plateau is within the Rayleigh range, however already before the end of the Rayleigh range the particles with excess momentum are being lost. Exactly at the Rayleigh range (after cell 81), the particle, that was initially the intersection of the ellipse diagonal with the aperture, is lost. The acceleration defocusing plays only a minor role for highly relativistic beams, i.e., the Rayleigh range is not significantly shortened. Figure 18 shows also the energy spectrum which becomes broader along the grating. This is due to particles being accelerated and decelerated according to their phase. Such spectra were also practically measured in [1,2]. The dashed lines in the plot show the same spectra in the case of zero transverse emittance, where also no loss on the aperture occurs.  \n  \n  \n C. Dynamics in tilted gratings  \n Finally, we address the tilted grating with the same laser parameters and a bunched electron beam with parameters $\\varepsilon _ { x } = \\varepsilon _ { y } = 1 \\ \\mathrm { n m } , \\sigma _ { x } = 1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } , \\sigma _ { y } = 0 . 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ $\\sigma _ { z } = 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ , $\\sigma _ { W } = 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { k e V }$ and a focusing angle of 5 mrad in the y-direction. The grating tilt angle is 70 degrees and again $| \\underline { { e } } _ { 1 } | = 1 \\ \\mathrm { G V / m }$ . Figure 19 shows the evolution of the phase space in all three planes. Evaluating Eq. (54), one finds $\\lambda _ { u } \\approx 1 6 0 \\lambda _ { 0 }$ , i.e., half an oscillation period in the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -direction in the displayed 80 grating cells.  \n As visible in Fig. 19, the horizontal and longitudinal phase spaces are correlated. The projections of the energy spectrum can be seen in Fig. 20 together with the particle loss, which takes place at the physical aperture in y-direction at $\\pm 4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . Unlike the straight grating with relativistic particles, the tilted grating creates a defocusing force in the y-direction which significantly decreases the Rayleigh range. The energy spread shows a breathing mode, similar to the quadrupole modes in the synchrotron motion. However, since the synchrotron motion is practically frozen due to the high $\\gamma$ , this mode arises entirely due to the correlation with the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -plane. Excluding the defocusing by setting $\\varepsilon _ { y } = 0$ , two coherent oscillation periods are displayed in Fig. 21.  \n  \n VI. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK  \n The laser fields in a periodic DLA grating can be represented by spatial Fourier harmonics, where only the resonant harmonic, which fulfills the Wideroe condition, provides a first order net kick. Exploiting this property, we showed that the entire 6D beam dynamics without collective effects can be modeled by applying kicks in all spatial directions once per grating period. These kicks are not independent, but analytically connected by the  \n Panofsky-Wenzel theorem. If the structure is not periodic, but slightly chirped (quasiperiodic), our approach is still applicable. However, fringe fields at the end of the structure are neglected.  \n As an example we introduced a novel Bragg-reflection based grating structure, which shows a particularly high first harmonic. The structure is discussed in [18,24] in more detail. Here we restrict ourselves in representing the grating structures by the one resonant Fourier coefficient, i.e., one complex number for each grating cell.  \n We also showed that our tracking approach still works for tilted gratings that have been proposed for beam deflection or optical undulators. However, in the case of curved gratings, which have been proposed for focusing, the fields cannot be determined analytically, since the decay constant is not uniform. In order to still use our tracking algorithm, the longitudinal kicks must be provided numerically for each pair of transverse coordinates.  \n Additionally to our fast, symplectic tracking approach, we also derived the Hamiltonian for the single particle motion in DLA structures. This allows analytical approaches to the 6D nonlinear and coupled equations of motion in DLA structures. In the case of constant synchronous phase, the longitudinal beam dynamics is identical to the one for conventional drift tube linacs. However, for longitudinally stable buckets, the transverse fields are always defocusing. Due to the high gradients in DLA, this strong defocusing cannot be compensated by ordinary means as magnets, which is particularly critical at low electron beam energy. At relativistic energies the full Rayleigh range of an externally focused beam can be reached, however this is also only in the range of several hundred microns.  \n In future a focusing scheme for DLA needs to be developed. One candidate is the proposed higher order harmonic focusing [17]. In order to simulate this with our code, the additional harmonic kicks would have to be implemented. The other candidate is alternating phase focusing (APF), which can be directly approached with our code. In this scheme the synchronous phase is alternated between longitudinally stable and unstable ranges, similarly as a FODO cell, but instead of x-y, rather in the y-z planes.  \n We plan to achieve such phase jumps by inserting drift sections as already outlined in Fig. 1. Other options are to modify the accelerating Fourier coefficient in each cell, e.g., by phase masking within the structure or by active phase control of individual parts of the laser pulse. In general, we believe that this paper gives a beam dynamics foundation on which DLA structures providing stable long distance beam transport schemes can be developed.  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n The authors wish to thank Ingo Hofmann for proofreading the manuscript.

The envelope of an externally focused beam is  \n $$\nw = w _ { 0 } \\sqrt { 1 + \\left( \\frac { z } { z _ { 0 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } .\n$$ \n Inserting into the envelope equation  \n $$\nw ^ { \\prime \\prime } = w ^ { - 3 }\n$$ \n results in $w _ { 0 } = \\sqrt { z _ { 0 } }$ . The beam size is given by $a ( z ) =$ $\\sqrt { \\varepsilon } w ( z )$ and thus the Rayleigh length is $z _ { 0 } = a _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } / \\varepsilon$ , where $a _ { 0 }$ is the beam size at the waist. The beam size at the Rayleigh length, where it is limited by the aperture, is $a _ { 1 } = \\sqrt { 2 } a _ { 0 }$ . The full Rayleigh range $L _ { R } = 2 z _ { 0 }$ as function of the full aperture $A = 2 a _ { 1 }$ is thus  \n $$\nL _ { R } = \\frac { A ^ { 2 } } { 4 \\varepsilon } .\n$$ \n The same result is obtained for a light beam, where the emittance is identified with the wavelength, i.e., $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { l i g h t } } = \\lambda _ { 0 } / \\pi$  \n [1] E. a.

However, stable beam transport and staging have not been shown experimentally yet. We present a scheme that confines the beam longitudinally and in one transverse direction. Confinement in the other direction is obtained by a single conventional quadrupole magnet. Within the small aperture of $4 2 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ we find the matched distributions, which allow an optimized injection into pure transport, bunching, and accelerating structures. The combination of these resembles the photonics analogue of the radio frequency quadrupole, but since our setup is entirely two dimensional, it can be manufactured on a microchip by lithographic techniques. This is a crucial step towards relativistic electrons in the MeV range from low-cost, handheld devices and connects the two fields of attosecond physics and accelerator physics.  \n DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.214801  \n Since dielectric-laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons was proposed in 1962 [1,2], the development of photonic nanostructures and the control of ultrashort laser pulses has advanced significantly (see Ref. [3] for an overview). Phase synchronous acceleration was experimentally demonstrated first in 2013 [4,5]. Damage threshold limited record gradients, more than an order of magnitude higher than in conventional accelerators, were achieved meanwhile for both relativistic [6] and low-energy electrons [7]. These gradients, so far, express themselves only in the generation of energy spread, not as a coherent acceleration. Moreover, the interaction length is limited to the Rayleigh length, after which the electron beam defocuses and hits the small (submicrometer) aperture. During synchronous acceleration, there are additional defocusing forces which cannot be overcome by magnetic focusing only [8] since equivalent magnetic focusing gradients would have to be in the MT/m range [9].  \n In this Letter we solve this outstanding problem with a laser-based scheme which allows transport and acceleration of electrons in dielectric nanostructures over arbitrary lengths. It is applicable to changing DLA period lengths, which is required to accelerate subrelativistic electrons. Moreover, we find the maximum tolerable emittances and beam envelopes in DLA beam channels. Another substantial advancement of our scheme is ballistic bunching of subrelativistic electrons down to attosecond duration, while the beam remains transversely confined. Thus, our scheme makes DLA scalable, which paves the way for a low-cost accelerator on a microchip, providing electrons in the MeV range from a small-scale, potentially handheld device.  \n  \n Our scheme uses only one spatial harmonic, namely, the synchronous one, but its magnitude and phase change along the DLA grating. This is interpreted as a time dependent focusing potential. A focusing concept using nonsynchronous spatial harmonics of traveling waves was presented by Naranjo et al. [10]. They derived stability due to retracting ponderomotive forces from the nonsynchronous spatial harmonics, while the synchronous one serves for acceleration. Our description is in the comoving real space, as compared to Naranjo’s description in the spatial frequency domain. This supports changes of all grating-related quantities, while the Courant-Snyder (CS) theory [11] from conventional accelerator physics is still applicable. Stable beam confinement is achieved by alternating-phase focusing (APF), which had already been developed in the 1950s for ion acceleration [12–14]. However, the later developed radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) cavities turned out to have better performance, especially for high current beams. Thus, APF was rejected in favor of the RFQ and was only rarely implemented [14]. In the 1980s APF was also proposed for grating-based linacs [15–18], but these three-dimensional designs are hardly feasible at optical wavelengths. Since 3D structures such as RFQs or rotated gratings are not feasible for lithographic fabrication on a microchip, we present an entirely two-dimensional APF scheme in this Letter, enabling stable and almost lossless electron transport in high-gradient DLA.  \n We use standing wave dual pillar structures [7] as shown in Fig. 1, but our scheme can also be applied to Bragg cavity structures [19]. The $z$ -polarized lasers, incident from both lateral sides, are modeled as plane waves with wavelength $\\lambda _ { 0 } = 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . In practice, they can be realized as pulsefront-tilted profiles [20–23] or on-chip wave guide systems [24]; see the Supplemental Material [9] for details. The tilted pulses appear to a single or a few electron bunches as a plane wave; however, the pulse duration impinging on each pillar is significantly reduced, and thus the damage threshold field strength is increased [25,26]. The Hamiltonian for single particle motion in the DLA is [27]  \n $$\nH = \\frac { 1 } { 2 m _ { e } \\gamma } [ p _ { x } ^ { 2 } + p _ { y } ^ { 2 } + ( \\Delta p _ { z } / \\gamma ) ^ { 2 } ] + V ,\n$$ \n where $\\gamma = ( 1 - \\beta ^ { 2 } ) ^ { - 1 / 2 }$ is the reference mass factor, $m _ { e }$ the electron mass, $p _ { x } , p _ { y }$ the transverse momenta, and $\\Delta p _ { z }$ the deviation of longitudinal momentum from the reference particle at fixed laser phase (the black dot in Fig. 1). In [27] we showed by means of the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [28] that the time dependent potential can be written as (see also the Supplemental Material [9])  \n $$\nV = q \\mathrm { I m } \\Bigg \\{ e _ { 1 } \\Bigg [ \\frac { \\lambda _ { g } } { 2 \\pi } \\mathrm { c o s h } \\Bigg ( \\frac { \\omega y } { \\beta \\gamma c } \\Bigg ) e ^ { 2 \\pi i s / \\lambda _ { g } } - i s e ^ { i \\varphi _ { s } } \\Bigg ] \\Bigg \\} ,\n$$ \n where $\\omega = 2 \\pi c / \\lambda _ { 0 }$ is the laser angular frequency, $q$ is the (negative) electron charge, and $s$ is the distance of the particle behind the reference particle. The field strength of the resonant harmonic with the Wideroe condition $\\lambda _ { g } = \\beta \\lambda _ { 0 }$ is $\\boldsymbol { e } _ { 1 }$ ; i.e., with no loss of generality we work with the first (usually the strongest) spatial harmonic. The parameters $e _ { 1 } , \\varphi _ { s } , \\beta , \\gamma$ , and $\\lambda _ { g }$ are allowed to vary with the timelike cell index $n$ . The synchronous phase $\\varphi _ { s }$ determines the energy gain of the reference particle as a function of the cell number (the acceleration ramp) as  \n $$\nW _ { \\mathrm { k i n } } ( N ) = W _ { \\mathrm { k i n , 0 } } + q \\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { N } \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( n ) } { \\mathrm { R e } } \\{ e _ { 1 } ^ { ( n ) } e ^ { i \\varphi _ { s } ^ { ( n ) } } \\} ,\n$$ \n where $W _ { \\mathrm { k i n , 0 } } = 8 3 ~ \\mathrm { k e V }$ is the injection energy. The cell lengths increase according to the Wideroe condition as  \n $$\n\\frac { \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( n + 1 ) } - \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( n ) } } { \\lambda _ { 0 } } = \\beta ^ { ( n + 1 ) } - \\beta ^ { ( n ) } = \\frac { q \\lambda _ { 0 } \\mathrm { R e } \\{ e _ { 1 } ^ { ( n ) } e ^ { i \\varphi _ { s } ^ { ( n ) } } \\} } { m _ { e } c ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { ( n ) ^ { 3 } } } .\n$$ \n For a given structure the synchronous phase is thus determined as $\\varphi _ { s } ^ { ( n ) } = \\varphi _ { 0 } - \\arg ( e _ { 1 } ) ^ { ( n ) }$ , where  \n $$\n\\varphi _ { 0 } = \\operatorname { a r c c o s } { \\left( \\frac { m _ { e } c ^ { 2 } } { q \\lambda _ { 0 } } \\frac { \\gamma ^ { 3 } } { | e _ { 1 } | } \\frac { \\Delta \\lambda _ { g } } { \\lambda _ { 0 } } \\right) } .\n$$ \n In this Letter we use optimized structures which provide $\\varphi _ { 0 }$ independent of $n$ at an arbitrary chirp parameter $\\Delta \\lambda _ { g } .$ , such that the synchronous phase $\\varphi _ { s }$ can be switched by a particular drift from one grating segment to another. Tying the phase $\\arg ( e _ { 1 } ) ^ { ( n ) }$ to $\\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( n ) }$ does not avoid a small drift in the normalized amplitude $| e _ { 1 } ^ { ( n ) } / E _ { L } | \\approx 0 . 3 4 . . . 0 . 3 9$ (see the Supplemental Material [9]), which is taken into account in the ramp [Eq. (3)].  \n Earnshaw’s theorem dictates that constant focusing cannot be achieved in all three spatial directions simultaneously [29]. Thus, at least two focusing directions have to be alternating. In conventional Alvarez linacs or in synchrotrons constant focusing is applied in the longitudinal direction and alternating quadrupole lattices provide transverse confinement [30]. In our APF scheme, we apply the alternation to the disjoint focusing phase ranges of the longitudinal plane and the noninvariant transverse plane $( y )$ . Jumping the reference particle by means of a fractional cell drift between the orange circles in Fig. 2 provides stable transport at constant energy, and between the red dots we additionally obtain acceleration. The strong acceleration defocusing in $y$ is compensated by acceleration focusing at the longitudinally unstable phase. In the invariant $x$ direction a single conventional quadrupole magnet [9] suffices to confine the beam to an area in the center of the structure height, where the laser fields are homogeneous, i.e., do not depend on $x$ .  \n We find the fixed points of the motion by setting $\\nabla V = 0$ as $s _ { f 1 } = \\varphi _ { s } \\lambda _ { g } / 2 \\pi$ and $s _ { f 2 } = - \\lambda _ { g } / 2 \\pi [ \\varphi _ { s } + 2 \\arg ( e _ { 1 } ) ]$ and define $\\Delta s _ { 1 } = s - s _ { f 1 }$ and $\\Delta s _ { 2 } = s - s _ { f 2 }$ . Note that in the longitudinal plane for $\\arg ( e _ { 1 } ) = 0$ the fixed point $s _ { f 1 }$ is elliptic and $s _ { f 2 }$ is hyperbolic, and vice versa in the transverse plane. Expanding $V$ to second order and omitting constant terms shows the APF principle:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { V ( x , y , s = s _ { f 1 } + \\Delta s ) = - V ( x , y , s = s _ { f 2 } + \\Delta s ) } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle ~ = \\frac { q | e _ { 1 } | \\lambda _ { g } } { 2 \\pi } \\left[ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\left( \\frac { \\omega y } { \\beta \\gamma c } \\right) ^ { 2 } - \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi } { \\lambda _ { g } } \\Delta s \\right) ^ { 2 } \\right] \\sin ( \\varphi _ { 0 } ) } ; }  \\end{array}\n$$ \n i.e., switching between $s _ { f 1 }$ and $s _ { f 2 }$ with $\\Delta s = \\Delta s _ { 1 } = \\Delta s _ { 2 }$ flips the sign of the potential. Only the nonaccelerating case $( \\varphi _ { 0 } = \\pi / 2 )$ provides two interchangeable buckets, whereas a $\\pi$ -shifted version of the accelerating bucket will be decelerating and unstable due to a mismatch with the ramp. Hill’s equations of the linearized motion are found from Eqs. (1) and (5) as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { y ^ { \\prime \\prime } + K y = 0 , } } \\\\ { { } } \\\\ { { \\Delta s ^ { \\prime \\prime } - K \\Delta s = 0 , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $K = | q \\omega e _ { 1 } / ( m _ { e } \\beta ^ { 3 } \\gamma ^ { 3 } c ^ { 3 } ) | \\sin ( \\varphi _ { s } )$ . Note that linearization leads to decoupling of the nonlinear equations of motion, which are coupled due to Eq. (2). The segments between two phase shifts are enumerated by $P$ such that  \n $$\n\\arg ( e _ { 1 } ) ( P ) = { \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l l } { 0 , } & { P { \\mathrm { ~ o d d } } , } \\\\ { 2 \\varphi _ { 0 } , } & { P { \\mathrm { ~ e v e n } } } \\end{array} \\right. }\n$$ \n leads to a sign alternation in the focusing function $K$ in Eq. (6). In order to switch between the two fixed points we take short drift sections denoted by $l$ and model the lattice as thick lenses of lengths $L ^ { f }$ and $L ^ { d }$ . Each lattice cell consists of two segments and has $p$ transverse focusing and $p$ transverse defocusing elements; thus, its length is given by $L = L ^ { f } + l ^ { f } + L ^ { d } + l ^ { d }$ , where  \n $$\nL ^ { f } = \\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { p } \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( n ) } , \\qquad L ^ { d } = \\sum _ { n = p + 1 } ^ { 2 p } \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( n ) } ,\n$$ \n $$\nl ^ { f } = ( 2 \\pi - \\varphi _ { s } ^ { ( p ) } ) \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( p ) } / \\pi , ~ l ^ { d } = ( \\pi - \\varphi _ { s } ^ { ( 2 p ) } ) \\lambda _ { g } ^ { ( 2 p ) } / \\pi .\n$$ \n The solution to Eq. (6) is found by applying the CS formalism [11] to the channel of thick focusing $( F )$ and defocusing $( D )$ elements. We start with a nonaccelerating transport structure, i.e., $\\varphi _ { 0 } = \\pi / 2$ , where the lattice cells are strictly periodic. In a long lattice cell $( p \\gg 1 )$ we can neglect the drift sections and represent it as [9]  \n $$\n\\mathbf { M } ( z , L ) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l l } { \\mathbf { M } _ { f } ( z ) , } & { 0 < z < L / 2 , } \\\\ { \\mathbf { M } _ { d } ( z - L / 2 ) \\mathbf { M } _ { f } ( L / 2 ) , } & { L / 2 < z < L , } \\end{array} \\right.\n$$ \n with the length ${ \\cal L } = ( 2 p + 1 ) \\lambda _ { g }$ . The phase advance per cell $\\sigma$ is given for a strictly periodic $F D$ -cell by  \n $$\n\\cos ( \\sigma ) = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\mathrm { T r } \\{ \\mathbf { M } ( L , L ) \\} = \\cos \\left( \\frac { \\sqrt { K } L } { 2 } \\right) \\cosh \\left( \\frac { \\sqrt { K } L } { 2 } \\right) .\n$$ \n The CS parameters $\\boldsymbol { \\eta } = ( \\hat { \\beta } , \\hat { \\alpha } , \\hat { \\gamma } ) ^ { \\mathrm { T } }$ are mapped from one point to another by the matrix $\\mathbf { T }$ (see the Supplemental Material [9]) and fulfill the eigenvector relation $\\eta _ { e } = \\mathbf { T } \\eta _ { e }$ for their initial values. For small $\\sigma$ the constant $\\hat { \\boldsymbol { \\beta } }$ function in the smooth approximation is found from $\\langle { \\hat { \\beta } } \\rangle = L / \\sigma$ . However, the most critical issue in DLA is to match a given emittance to the tiny aperture. Thus, the maximum of the $\\hat { \\boldsymbol { \\beta } }$ function, which appears at $L / 4$ , needs to be minimal (see Fig. 3). The only variable parameter in an experimental setup is the laser field strength. Its tuning range from maximal admissible beam size to the structure damage threshold [25,26] is indicated by the black arrow. The evolution of the transverse phase space is shown below, where the particles were initially arranged on a Cartesian grid and only the longterm surviving ones are displayed in red. For simplicity, this simulation starts at $L / 4$ in order to avoid correlations in the conjugate variables. This plot uses zero bunch length, but stability is also attained for an unbunched beam; see the video in the Supplemental Material [9]. The blue ellipses indicate the strictly periodic linear case, which is slightly smaller in area due to the cosh potential in Eq. (2) being steeper than the square well in Eq. (5). In the linear case the single particle emittances are invariants  \n  \n $$\n\\varepsilon ( y , y ^ { \\prime } ) = \\hat { \\gamma } y ^ { 2 } + 2 \\hat { \\alpha } y y ^ { \\prime } + \\hat { \\beta } y ^ { \\prime 2 } ,\n$$ \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { L } ( \\Delta s , \\Delta s ^ { \\prime } ) = \\hat { \\gamma } _ { L } \\Delta s ^ { 2 } + 2 \\hat { \\alpha } _ { L } \\Delta s \\Delta s ^ { \\prime } + \\hat { \\beta } _ { L } \\Delta s ^ { \\prime 2 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\Delta s ^ { \\prime } = \\Delta W / ( m _ { e } \\gamma ^ { 3 } \\beta ^ { 2 } c ^ { 2 } )$ , and we introduce longitudinal CS functions as a half lattice cell shift of the transverse ones, $\\eta _ { L } ( z ) = \\eta ( z - L / 2 )$ .  \n An accelerating lattice can be attained by taking the initial values from the eigenvalue solution and successively multiplying the segment maps as $\\eta _ { N } = \\mathbf { T } _ { N } . . . \\mathbf { T } _ { 1 } \\eta _ { e }$ to it. In nonperiodic lattices the longitudinal CS functions have to be calculated individually with the same procedure. If the change in length from one period to another is small, the $\\hat { \\boldsymbol { \\beta } }$ function can be approximated by the eigenvalue solution in each cell, which is, however, discontinuous at the boundaries. The line of increasing minimum of $\\hat { \\beta } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ in Fig. 4 is followed only approximately. The increase is counteracted by adiabatic emittance damping due to momentum conservation. Altogether the beam envelope can be written as [30]  \n  \n $$\na ( z ) = \\sqrt { \\hat { \\beta } ( z ) \\frac { \\varepsilon _ { 0 } \\beta _ { 0 } \\gamma _ { 0 } } { \\beta ( z ) \\gamma ( z ) } } ,\n$$ \n where the 0 indices denote initial values. Acceleration from $8 3 \\mathrm { k e V }$ to $1 \\mathrm { M e V }$ at $\\varphi _ { 0 } = 4 \\pi / 3$ , with an average gradient of $1 8 7 ~ \\mathrm { M e V / m }$ and $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { M V / m }$ incident laser field strength from both sides, is shown to be well confined within the physical aperture of $\\pm 0 . 2 1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in Fig. 5. The analytical and numerical results coincide for infinitesimally low emittance. At small but achievable emittances [31,32], we obtain $56 \\%$ transmission for $\\varepsilon _ { 0 } = 1 0 0 \\mathrm { p m }$ (see the video in the Supplemental Material [9]), and $9 3 \\%$ for $\\varepsilon _ { 0 } = 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { p m }$ . The phase space density at top energy is plotted in Fig. 6, where $\\Phi _ { P }$ and $\\Delta W$ are the longitudinal coordinates in the comoving (Galilean) laboratory frame. As in Fig. 3, the initial particle positions in Fig. 6 (left panel) are arranged on a Cartesian grid, and only the ones that make it to $1 \\mathrm { M e V }$ are drawn in red. The blue ellipse corresponds to an initially matched bunch adjusted to the area of the surviving particles. Note that this size is slightly reduced at finite transverse emittance; thus, we choose $\\sigma _ { z } = 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . Below this bunch length the transmission depends only on the initial transverse emittance, i.e., is fully scalable.  \n The APF scheme discussed here can also be used to attain the bunching needed to inject into the accelerator structure. Creating and removing sinusoidal energy spread (see the Supplemental Material [9] and the video therein) results in extremely short (attosecond) bunch lengths at acceptably low energy spread. The phase alternation additionally provides transverse confinement, which can be matched to the initial CS functions of the accelerator. The particles not captured are defocused, while the captured ones remain at small longitudinal and transverse amplitudes, within the limits of Liouville’s theorem. The phase space after the buncher is plotted in Fig. 7. Both ellipses are matched for the injection into the accelerator (the blue ellipses in Figs. 7 and 6 are identical). Before the buncher the energy spread is ${ \\sigma _ { \\Delta W } = 1 6 ~ \\mathrm { e V } }$ . The initial longitudinal emittance equals the final one in the ellipse which has $2 5 \\%$ of the particles captured. The duration is decreased to $4 \\%$ ( ${ \\approx } 2 6 0$ as), whereas the energy spread is increased by the same ratio. The initial CS functions are determined by inverse mapping of the desired final values for the accelerator. Additionally to the injection into DLAs, these short bunches are also very promising for ultrafast time-resolved electron microscopy.  \n  \n In conclusion, we developed a scheme that makes DLA fully scalable. We showed for the first time how a focusing lattice, which relies on APF only, can be integrated. The entire accelerator or parts such as a single focusing stage or the buncher can now be experimentally approached. Acceleration of sub- $1 0 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ electrons from readily available sources up to the MeV range with gradients of several $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M e V / m }$ works with transmission rates well above $90 \\%$ . The admissible synchronous phase is determined by the available bunch length at injection. We showed that controlling this nonlinear dependence is crucial to avoiding particle loss. Our bunching scheme provides the required attosecond bunches with the matched energy spread and a reasonable capture rate of $2 5 \\%$ . In principle, fully adiabatic bunching as in the RFQ is also possible. This would, however, require a larger total length. The APF scheme can also be scaled to higher energies, where smaller beam size and larger physical apertures due to longer roll-off of the evanescent acceleration fields will ease the requirements.  \n U.

Pump−probe experiments at free-electron lasers typically rely on THz radiation generated by optical rectification of ultrafast laser pulses in electro-optic crystals. A compact and cost-efficient alternative is offered by the Smith−Purcell effect: a charged particle beam passes a periodic structure and generates synchronous radiation. Here, we employ the technique of photonic inverse design to optimize a structure for Smith− Purcell radiation at a single wavelength from ultrarelativistic electrons. The resulting design is highly resonant and emits narrowbandly. Experiments with a 3D-printed model for a wavelength of $9 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ show coherent enhancement. The versatility of inverse design offers a simple adaption of the structure to other electron energies or radiation wavelengths. This approach could advance beam-based THz generation for a wide range of applications.  \n  \n KEYWORDS: THz generation, Smith−Purcell radiation, inverse design, light−matter interaction, free-electron light sources $\\mathbf { C }$ aopuprlciecs iof ,TiHnzc rdaidniagtiwoinr aerses ofmimntuenriecsat fonr ,n2uelmeecrtrouns acceleration,3−5 and biomedical and material science.6,7 Freeelectron laser (FEL) facilities demand versatile THz sources for pump−probe experiments.8 Intense, broadband THz pulses up to sub-mJ pulse energy have been demonstrated using optical rectification of high-power femtosecond lasers in lithium niobate crystals.9,10 The Smith−Purcell effect11 offers a compact and cost-efficient alternative for the generation of beam-synchronous THz radiation at electron accelerators. This effect describes the emission of electromagnetic waves from a periodic metallic or dielectric structure excited by electrons moving parallel to its surface. The wavelength of Smith− Purcell radiation at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the electron beam follows:11  \n  \n $$\n\\lambda = \\frac { a } { m } \\Biggl ( \\frac { 1 } { \\beta } - \\cos { \\theta } \\Biggr )\n$$ \n where $\\beta$ is the normalized velocity of the electrons, a is the periodicity of the structure, and $m$ is the mode order. Smith− Purcell emission from regular metallic grating surfaces has been observed in numerous experiments, first using $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { k e V }$ electrons11 and later also using ultrarelativistic electrons.12,13 If electron pulses shorter than the emitted wavelength are used, the fields from individual electrons add coherently, and the radiated energy scales quadratically with the bunch charge.14 The typically used single-sided gratings emit a broadband spectrum,15 which is dispersed by the Smith−Purcell relation (eq 1). To enhance emission at single frequencies, a concept called orotron uses a metallic mirror above the grating to form a resonator.16,17 Dielectrics can sustain fields 1−2 orders of magnitude larger than metals18 and are therefore an attractive material for strong Smith−Purcell interactions.  \n  \n Inverse design is a computational technique that has been successfully employed to advance integrated photonics.19 Algorithms to discover optical structures fulfilling desired functional characteristics are creating a plethora of novel subwavelength geometries: applications include wavelengthdependent beam splitters19,20 and couplers,21 as well as dielectric laser accelerators.22  \n RESULTS  \n The goal of our inverse design optimization was a narrowband dielectric Smith−Purcell radiator for ultrarelativistic electrons $\\mathit { \\check { E } } = 3 . 2 \\ \\mathrm { G e V }$ , $\\gamma \\approx 6 0 0 0 ,$ ). To simplify the collection of the THz radiation, a periodicity of $a = \\lambda$ was chosen, resulting in an emission perpendicular to the electron propagation direction, $\\theta \\ : = \\ : 9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . The optimization was based on a 2D finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) simulation of a single unit cell of the grating (Figure 1a). Periodic boundaries in direction of the electron propagation ensure the desired periodicity, and perfectly matched layers in the transverse xdirection imitate free space. The design region extends $4 . 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ to each side of a $1 5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ wide vacuum channel, large enough to facilitate the full transmission of the electron beam with a width of $\\sigma _ { x } = 3 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (RMS). The electric current spectral density $\\scriptstyle \\mathbf { J } ( x , y , \\omega )$ of a single electron bunch acts here as the source term of our simulation and is given by  \n  \n $$\n{ \\bf J } ( x , y , \\omega ) = \\frac { q } { 2 \\pi } { \\cdot } ( 2 \\pi \\sigma _ { x } ^ { 2 } ) ^ { - 1 / 2 } { \\cdot } e ^ { - x ^ { 2 } / 2 \\sigma _ { x } ^ { 2 } } { \\cdot } e ^ { - i k _ { \\mathrm { y } } y } \\hat { \\bf y }\n$$ \n with the electron wavevector $k _ { y } = 2 \\pi / \\beta \\lambda$ and the line charge density $q$ . The absolute value of $q$ is irrelevant for the optimization, but rough agreement with 3D simulations is found by choosing $q \\sim Q / { \\dot { d } } ,$ where $Q$ is the bunch charge and $d$ the charge-structure distance.23  \n The optimization problem was to find a design (parametrized by the variable $\\phi$ ) that maximizes the radiation to both sides of the grating. Exploiting the full symmetry of the double-sided, perpendicular emission process, we enforced mirror and point symmetry with respect to the center of a unit cell of the grating. The design is defined by its relative permittivity $\\bar { \\varepsilon ( x , y , \\phi ) }$ and can only take the two values of vacuum, $\\varepsilon ~ = ~ 1$ , or the structure material, $\\varepsilon \\ = \\ 2 . 7 9$ . For simplicity, we neglected the small imaginary part $\\varepsilon ^ { \\prime \\prime } = 0 . 0 8$ of the material.24  \n  \n The objective function $G$ , quantifying the performance of a design $\\phi ,$ is given by the line integral of the Poynting vector $\\begin{array} { r } { { \\bf S } ( x , y ) = \\mathrm { R e } \\left\\{ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } { \\bf E } \\times { \\bf H } ^ { * } \\right\\} } \\end{array}$ in the $x$ -direction along the length of one period, evaluated at a point $x _ { S }$ outside the design region:  \n $$\nG ( \\phi ) = \\int _ { 0 } ^ { a } S _ { x } ( x _ { S } , y ) \\mathrm { d } y\n$$ \n The optimization problem can then be stated as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\operatorname* { m a x } _ { \\phi } G ( \\phi ) \\quad \\mathrm { s u b j e c t t o } \\quad \\nabla \\times \\mathbf { E } = - i \\omega \\mu \\mathbf { H } \\quad \\mathrm { a n d } } \\\\ & { \\quad \\nabla \\times \\epsilon ( \\phi ) ^ { - 1 } \\nabla \\times \\mathbf { H } - \\omega ^ { 2 } \\mu \\mathbf { H } = \\nabla \\times \\epsilon ( \\phi ) ^ { - 1 } \\mathbf { J } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The design obtained from the gradient-based technique of adaptive moment estimation $( \\mathrm { A d a m } ) ^ { 2 . 5 }$ is depicted in Figure 1b. The structure features two rows of pillars, shifted by half a period with respect to each other. The rows of pillars are followed by three slabs on each side, which can be easily identified as distributed Bragg reflectors forming a microresonator around the electron channel. The channel width is $2 7 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ , even larger than the initially defined clearance of 150 $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . These slabs exhibit grooves, which perhaps act as a grating as well as a reflector. We note that these features are good examples of the superiority of inverse design over intuitionbased designs.  \n  \n To fabricate the geometry obtained with inverse design, we used an additive manufacturing process for poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). A stereolithography device, featuring a resolution of $1 4 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ , is capable of reproducing the structure with subwavelength accuracy. The so-obtained structure is 6 mm high and $4 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ long (Figure 1d). The holder of the structure was manufactured together with the structure, and filaments connect the pillars and slabs on top of the structure for increased mechanical stability. We selected the Formlabs High Temperature Resin as a material for this study due to its excellent vacuum compatibility after curing in a heated vacuum chamber.24 Afterward, the fabricated Smith−Purcell radiator was inserted into the ACHIP experimental chamber26 at SwissFEL27 (Figure 2a). The photoemitted electron bunch is accelerated to an energy of $3 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { \\ G e V }$ with the normalconducting radio frequency accelerator at SwissFEL. A twostage compression scheme using magnetic chicanes is employed to achieve an electron bunch length of approximately 30 fs at the interaction point. At this location, the transverse beam size was measured to be around $3 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in the horizontal and $4 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ in the vertical direction.  \n An in-vacuum PMMA lens with a diameter of $2 5 \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ collimated parts of the emitted radiation. A Michelson interferometer was used to measure the first-order autocorrelation of the electromagnetic pulse and to obtain its power spectrum via Fourier transform (Figure 2b and Methods). The measured spectrum is centered around 881 $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ $\\left( 0 . 3 4 ~ \\mathrm { T H z } \\right)$ and has a full width at half-maximum of ${ \\sim } 9 \\%$ (Figure 3).  \n DISCUSSION  \n The observed spectrum agrees well with a 3D finite-differences time-domain (FDTD) simulation of the experiment (Figure 3). In contrast, a finite-differences frequency-domain (FDFD)  \n simulation reveals that the design can in principal emit even more narrowbandly, originating from the high mode density inside the Fabry−Perot cavity formed by the two distributed Bragg reflectors on both sides of the electron channel. The difference between the two simulations can be explained by their distinct grid resolutions. The FDFD simulation considers only a single period of the structure with periodic boundaries, corresponding to an infinitely long structure. Hence, the cell size is small, allowing to use a high grid resolution. The timedomain simulation, on the other hand, calculates the electromagnetic field of the entire 50-period-long structure for each time step. This high memory requirement comes at the cost of a lower spatial resolution. Since the experiment was similarly limited by the fabrication resolution of $1 4 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ the FDTD simulation reproduced the measured spectrum much better. We also note that potential absorption losses in the structure can reduce its quality factor and broaden the radiation spectrum. Due to the small contribution from $\\varepsilon ^ { \\prime \\prime } =$ $0 . 0 8 , ^ { 2 4 }$ absorption effects were not considered here but would dominate at higher quality factors.  \n We drove the structure with electron bunches with a duration of approximately 30 fs (RMS), which is much shorter than the resonant wavelength corresponding to a period of 3 ps. Hence, we expect to see the coherent addition of radiated fields. To experimentally verify this, we varied the bunch charge. Figure 4 shows the detected pulse energy for six bunch charge settings ranging from $0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ to $1 1 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ The scaling is well approximated by a quadratic fit, which confirms the expected coherent enhancement of the $\\mathrm { T H z }$ pulse energy.14 We observe a slight deviation for the highest charge measurement from the quadratic fit, which might be a result of detector saturation (see Methods). We note that the quadratic scaling would enable $\\mathrm { T H z }$ pulse energies orders of magnitude larger by driving the structure at higher bunch charges.  \n  \n The THz pulse emitted perpendicular to the Smith-Purcell radiator possesses a pulse-front tilt of close to $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ since it is driven by ultrarelativistic electrons. Depending on the length of the radiator and the application, the tilt can be compensated for with a diffraction grating.  \n During and after our experiments, the structure did not show any signs of performance degradation or visible damage. It was used continuously for eight hours with a bunch charge of approximately $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ at a pulse repetition rate of $1 \\ \\mathrm { H z }$ .  \n  \n CONCLUSION  \n The here-presented beam-synchronous radiation source can be added to the beamline of an FEL to enrich capabilities for pump−probe experiments. For ultrarelativistic electrons, a second beamline may be used to compensate for the longer path length of the THz radiation and achieve simultaneous arrival with the X-ray radiation created in the undulator of the FEL (Figure 5a). Smith−Purcell radiation represents a costefficient alternative to the broadband generation of THz by optical rectification, which requires an external laser system and precise synchronization to the accelerator. Our inverse design approach to Smith−Purcell emitters can produce beamsynchronous narrowband THz radiation, which could propel pump−probe studies with THz excitations in solids, for instance, resonant control of strongly correlated electron systems, high-temperature superconductors, or vibrational modes of crystal lattices (phonons).28,29  \n Further improvement of our THz structure can be achieved by higher fabrication accuracy and the use of a fully 3Doptimized geometry with a higher quality factor, resulting in more narrowband emission and higher pulse energy. Moreover, the inverse design suite could be extended to composite structures of more than one material, which could provide extra stability for complicated 3D designs. In the case of highly resonant structures, materials with low absorption, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),24 are a necessity. The measured THz pulse energy can be increased by a factor of almost 300 by raising the driving bunch charge from the used $1 1 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ up to the $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ available at SwissFEL. Whether the currently used material can withstand such high fields and radiation remains to be investigated. Combining 3D optimization, longer structures, larger collection optics, and higher bunch charges will result in a THz pulse energy multiple orders of magnitude larger than observed in the presented experiment $( 0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { p J } )$ .  \n Our work naturally extends to the field of subrelativistic electrons. Here, simultaneous arrival of THz radiation and electron bunches is readily achieved by compensating for the higher velocity of the radiation with a longer path length (Figure 5b). Besides its application for pump−probe experiments, our structure can be more generally applied as a radiation source at wavelengths that are otherwise difficult to generate. An advantage lies in the tunability that arises from changing the periodicity, either by replacing the entire structure or using a design with variable periodicity (Figure 5c), or from tuning the electron velocity. For the visible to UV regime, the idea of a compact device with the electron source integrated on a nanofabricated chip has recently sparked interest.30,31  \n  \n METHODS  \n Structure Parametrization. Our inverse design process was carried out with an open-source Python package32 suitable for 2D-FDFD gradient-based optimizations25 of the chosen objective function $G ( \\phi )$ with respect to the design parameter $\\phi$ . A key step lies in the parametrization of the structure $\\varepsilon ( \\phi )$ through the variable $\\phi$ in a way that ensures robust convergence of the algorithm and fabricability of the final design. In the most rudimentary case, $\\varepsilon ( x , y ) \\stackrel { \\cdot } { = } \\phi ( x , y )$ is a two-dimensional array with entries $\\in [ 1 , 2 . 7 9 ]$ for each pixel of the design area. Instead of setting bounds on the values of $\\phi ,$ we leave $\\phi$ unbounded and apply a sigmoid function of the shape  \n $$\n\\epsilon _ { r } ( x , y ) = \\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } + ( \\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } - \\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } ) { \\cdot } \\frac { 1 } { 2 } ( 1 + \\operatorname { t a n h } \\alpha \\phi ( x , y ) )\n$$ \n where large values of $\\alpha$ yield a close-to-binary design with few values between $\\varepsilon _ { \\operatorname* { m i n } } = 1$ and $\\varepsilon _ { \\operatorname* { m a x } } = 2 . 7 9$ . To avoid small or sharp features in the final design, we convolved $\\phi ( x , y )$ with a uniform 2D circular kernel with radius $6 0 \\mu \\mathrm m$ before projection onto the sigmoid function tanh $( \\alpha \\tilde { \\phi } )$ with the convolved design parameter $\\tilde { \\phi }$ . By increasing $\\alpha$ from 20 to 1000 as the optimization progresses, we found improved convergence. We further accelerated convergence by applying mirror and point symmetry with respect to the center of a unit cell of the grating, which reduces the parameter space by a factor of 4. An exemplary design evolution is shown in Figure 6.  \n Ultrarelativistic Optimization. The simulation of ultrarelativistic electrons poses challenges that have so far prevented inverse design in this regime.33 Here, we report on two main challenges. First, the electron velocity is close to the speed of light $( \\beta = 0 . 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 5$ for $E = 3 . 2 \\mathrm { G e V } ,$ ), which requires a high mesh resolution. If the numerical error is too large due to a low mesh resolution, the simulation may not be able to distinguish between $\\beta < 1$ and $\\beta > 1$ . In that case, the simulation could show Cherenkov radiation in vacuum instead of Smith−Purcell radiation.  \n Not only does a higher mesh resolution require more computational memory and time, but it may also hamper the inverse design optimization if the number of design parameters becomes too large. Hence, we parametrized our structures at a low resolution (mesh spacing $\\lambda / { 3 0 } \\mathrm { \\dot { } }$ ), which is still above the fabrication accuracy of $\\lambda / 5$ , and computed the fields at a high resolution (mesh spacing $\\lambda / { 1 5 0 } \\dot$ ).  \n The second difficulty arises from the long-range evanescent waves of ultrarelativistic electrons. The spectral density of the electric field of a line charge decays with $\\bar { \\exp ( - \\kappa | x | ) }$ , where $\\kappa =$ $2 \\pi / \\beta \\gamma \\lambda$ , with $\\beta \\approx 1$ and $\\gamma \\approx 6 0 0 0$ for $E = 3 . 2$ GeV.34 This means the evanescent waves will reach the boundaries of our simulation cell in the $x$ -direction. Generalized perfectly matched layers $\\left( \\mathrm { P M L s } \\right) ^ { 3 5 }$ are chosen, such that they can absorb both propagating and evanescent waves.  \n  \n A detailed look at Figure 1b reveals that our implementation of generalized PMLs is not fully capable of absorbing evanescent waves. Hence, we make use of symmetry to further reduce the effect of evanescent waves at the boundaries of the simulation cell. Note that the evanescent electric field for $\\beta \\approx 1$ is almost entirely polarized along the transverse direction $x .$ . This means if the simulation cell is mirror symmetric with respect to the electron channel, antiperiodic boundaries can be applied after the PMLs to cancel out the effect of evanescent waves at the boundaries. This turned out to work well for us, although the structure is not mirror symmetric with respect to the electron axis.  \n Simulations. The 3D frequency-domain simulation was performed in COMSOL, based on the finite element method. The simulation cell, as shown in the lower right inset of Figure 1c, consists of a single unit cell of the grating, with a height of 4 mm and periodic boundaries along the electron propagation direction. An optional phase shift at the boundaries in longitudinal direction enables simulations for nonperpendicular Smith-Purcell emission, $\\lambda \\neq a$ . Perfectly matched layers are applied in all remaining, transverse directions. The electron beam $\\stackrel { \\prime } { E } = 3 . 2 \\mathrm { G e V } _ { \\mathrm { ; } }$ ， $Q = e$ ) had a Gaussian shape of width $\\sigma _ { x } =$ $\\sigma _ { z } = 5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in the transverse direction.  \n The 3D time-domain simulation of the full structure, as shown in Figure 1c with the connecting filaments at the top and bottom, was performed in CST Studio Suite 2021. A single electron bunch $\\left( E = 3 \\mathrm { G e V } \\right)$ with Gaussian charge distribution was assumed. Its width in the transverse direction was $\\sigma _ { x } = \\sigma _ { z } =$ $0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ and in the longitudinal direction $\\sigma _ { y } = 0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ with cutoff length $0 . 4 \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ . The simulation was performed for a longer bunch length than the experimental bunch length due to computational resource limitations for smaller mesh cell resolutions. Nevertheless, we expect this approximation to yield a realistic emission spectrum, since the simulated bunch length is still substantially shorter than the central wavelength. A convergence test showed that a hexahedral mesh with a minimum cell size of $1 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ was sufficient. To imitate free space, perfectly matched layers and open-space boundary conditions were applied, where a $\\lambda / 2$ thick layer of vacuum was added after the dielectric structure. The radiation spectrum was then obtained via far-field approximations at multiple frequencies.  \n  \n Accelerator Setup. The experiments used $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ electron bunches from the $3 . 2 \\mathrm { G e V }$ Athos beamline of SwissFEL27 operated at a pulse repetition rate of $1 \\ \\mathrm { H z }$ to keep particle losses during alignment at a tolerable level. The standard bunch charge at SwissFEL is $2 0 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ at a repetition rate of 100 $\\mathrm { H z }$ . For the low charge working point, the aperture and intensity of the cathode laser are reduced. The normalized emittance of the electron beam with a charge of $9 . 5 \\ \\mathsf { p C }$ was $1 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { { \\ n m } }$ rad in both planes and was measured with a quadrupole scan in the injector at a beam energy of 150 MeV.36  \n For the experiment, we scanned the charge from 0 to 11.8 pC by adjusting the intensity of the cathode laser, which results in a slight emittance degradation and mismatch of the transverse beam parameters. This is due to charge density changes in the space charge dominated gun region. Nevertheless, the beam size remained small enough for full transmission through the THz Smith−Purcell structure.  \n A bunch length of 30 fs (RMS) was measured for similar machine settings in a separate shift with a transverse deflecting cavity (TDC) in the Aramis beamline of the accelerator. Therefore, we expect the longitudinal dimension of the electron beam at the ACHIP chamber to be on the order of $1 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm m ,$ , almost 2 orders of magnitude shorter than the period of the structure and radiated wavelength.  \n The transverse beam size at the interaction point was $3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in the horizontal and $4 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm m$ in the vertical direction (for a charge of $9 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { p C } ,$ ), as measured with a scintillating YAG screen imaged with an out-of-vacuum microscope onto a CCD camera. After position and angular alignment of the structure using an in-vacuum hexapod, the beam could be transmitted without substantial losses through the $2 7 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ wide channel of the THz generating structure.  \n Structure Fabrication. The structure was fabricated with a commercial PMMA stereolithography device Formlabs Form 2. The resolution of the device is $1 4 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } , }$ , which provides subwavelength feature sizes for the geometry with a periodicity of $9 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The height of the structure $( 6 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } ) }$ was limited by the stability of the structure rods during the fabrication process. The high temperature resin used for this study can be heated to $2 3 5 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . A sufficiently low outgassing rate for the installation at SwissFEL was achieved after baking the device for $s \\mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ under vacuum conditions at $1 7 5 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } . ^ { 2 4 }$ Thanks to the rapid improvements in SLA technology and other free-form manufacturing techniques, the geometry could certainly be fabricated also at shorter wavelengths and higher resolution for future experiments. An increased manufacturing quality is required to achieve an even narrower emission bandwidth.  \n Michelson Interferometer and THz Detector. For the spectrum measurements, we installed a Michelson interferometer outside the vacuum chamber. The THz pulse was first sent through an in-vacuum lens made of PMMA with a diameter of $2 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ and a focal length of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ . The lens collimates radiation in the vertical plane, but it does not map the entire radiation of the $4 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ long structure onto the detector. The angular acceptance in the horizontal plane is calculated via ray tracing (see Figure 3). A fused silica vacuum window with about $5 0 \\%$ transmission for the design wavelength of the structure $( 9 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ is used as extraction port.  \n  \n The beam splitter is made of $3 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ -thick plano−plano high-resistivity float-zone silicon (HRFZ-Si) manufactured by TYDEX. It provides a splitting ratio of $5 4 / 4 6$ for wavelengths ranging from 0.1 to $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . Translating one of the mirrors of the interferometer allowed us to measure the first-order autocorrelation, from which the power spectrum is obtained via Fourier transform.  \n The geometric acceptance angle of the Michelson interferometer $\\Delta \\theta$ in the plane of the electron beam and the THz radiation defines the accepted bandwidth of the setup. According to the Smith−Purcell relation (eq 1), it is given by  \n $$\n\\Delta \\lambda = a \\sin \\theta \\Delta \\theta\n$$ \n Around the orthogonal direction $( \\theta \\ : = \\ : 9 0 ^ { \\circ } ,$ ), the accepted bandwidth covers the measured spectrum (Figure 3). We calculated the acceptance with ray tracing including the size of the emitting structure and the apertures of the collimating lens $( 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m } )$ and the detector ( $\\cdot 1 2 \\ \\mathrm { m m } ,$ ).  \n A Schottky diode (ACST, Type 3DL 12C LS2500 A2) was used as THz detector, sensitive from 300 to $4 0 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ . The manufacturer indicates a responsivity of $1 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { V / W }$ at $9 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } , }$ , which we used to estimate the energy deposited on the detector. The signal from the detector is transmitted via a $2 0 \\mathrm { m }$ long coaxial cable to an oscilloscope outside of the accelerator bunker. For absolute pulse energy measurements, the detector setup including absorption in cables and the vacuum window should be characterized with a calibrated $\\mathrm { T H z }$ source. We calculated the pulse energy for different charges (Figure 4) by averaging over all shots during the oscillating autocorrelation measurement.  \n A typical autocorrelation measurement for a charge of 9.4 pC is depicted in Figure 2b. The shape of the autocorrelation is not perfectly symmetric in amplitude and stage position. The amplitude asymmetry could be a result of a nonlinear detector response (onset of saturation). This is in agreement with the slight deviation of the pulse energy from the quadratic fit (Figure 4). Since the length of only one arm is changed and the radiation might not be perfectly collimated, the position scan of the mirror is not creating a perfectly symmetric autocorrelation signal.  \n AUTHOR INFORMATION  \n Corresponding Author Rasmus Ischebeck − Paul Scherrer Institut, 5232 Villigen, PSI, Switzerland; $\\circledcirc$ orcid.org/0000-0002-5612-5828; Email: rasmus.ischebeck@psi.ch  \n Authors  \n Benedikt Hermann − Paul Scherrer Institut, 5232 Villigen, PSI, Switzerland; Institute of Applied Physics, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland; Galatea Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), 2000 Neuchâtel, Switzerland; $\\circledcirc$ orcid.org/0000-0001-9766-3270  \n Urs Haeusler − Department Physik, Friedrich-AlexanderUniversität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), 91058 Erlangen, Germany; Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0HE, United Kingdom; $\\circledcirc$ orcid.org/0000- 0002-6818-0576   \nGyanendra Yadav − Department of Physics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZE, United Kingdom; Cockcroft Institute, Warrington WA4 4AD, United Kingdom   \nAdrian Kirchner − Department Physik, Friedrich-AlexanderUniversität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), 91058 Erlangen, Germany   \nThomas Feurer − Institute of Applied Physics, University of Bern, 3012 Bern, Switzerland   \nCarsten Welsch − Department of Physics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 7ZE, United Kingdom; Cockcroft Institute, Warrington WA4 4AD, United Kingdom   \nPeter Hommelhoff − Department Physik, FriedrichAlexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), 91058 Erlangen, Germany  \n Complete contact information is available at: https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.1c01932  \n Author Contributions  \n #These authors contributed equally to this work.

Stupakov SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94309, USA (Received 31 July 2015; published 19 October 2015)  \n We consider the calculation of electromagnetic fields generated by an electron bunch passing through a vacuum chamber structure that, in general, consists of an entry pipe, followed by some kind of transition or cavity, and ending in an exit pipe. We limit our study to structures having rectangular cross section, where the height can vary as function of longitudinal coordinate but the width and side walls remain fixed. For such structures, we derive a Fourier representation of the wake potentials through one-dimensional functions. A new numerical approach for calculating the wakes in such structures is proposed and implemented in the computer code ECHO(2D). The computation resource requirements for this approach are moderate and comparable to those for finding the wakes in 2D rotationally symmetric structures. Numerical examples obtained with the new numerical code are presented.  \n DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevSTAB.18.104401  \n PACS numbers: 41.60.-m, 29.27.Bd, 02.60.Cb, 02.70.Bf  \n I. INTRODUCTION  \n The interaction of charged particle beams and the vacuum chamber environment can be quantified using the concept of impedance or wakefield [1]. In order to calculate electromagnetic fields in accelerators several different numerical approaches have been suggested and implemented in computer codes. Such calculations for complicated three dimensional structures, however, remain a challenge even for today’s parallel computers. The approaches suggested in papers [2–6] allow one to obtain reliable results for rotationally symmetric and general three-dimensional structures even when using a personal computer. However, fully three dimensional calculations can be cumbersome and require long computation times. In contrast, for rotationally symmetric structures, the modeling is much simpler, the execution time is much shorter, and the required computational resources are relatively modest.  \n Many three-dimensional vacuum chamber components used in particle accelerators can be well-approximated with structures of rectangular cross section whose height can vary as function of longitudinal coordinate but whose width and side walls remain fixed. Two examples of such geometry are shown in Fig. 1: (i) a corrugated structure that can be used as a dechirper [7], and (ii) a rectangular tapered collimator. Another example of great interest without symmetry in vertical direction is a vacuum chamber in a bunch compressor. Calculation of the wakefields for such structures can be greatly simplified by expanding the field generated by the beam into Fourier series. As it turns out, each Fourier harmonic can be solved separately, and the wakefield calculated as a sum of their contributions. This reduces the original 3D problem into a number of 2D ones, each of which requires much less computing resources than the original problem.  \n  \n In this paper we derive the equations for the Fourier harmonics and propose a computational scheme for their solution. The scheme was implemented in a computer code that we call ECHO(2D).  \n The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we apply the Fourier transform in the horizontal direction (the direction of constant width), and derive a system of equations for the Fourier harmonics. In Sec. III, we prove that the longitudinal wake function satisfies the Laplace equation with respect to the coordinates of the source particle. In Sec. IV, we show that, in the general case, the wakefield of each harmonic can be described by four scalar functions of one variable. The description is further simplified in Sec. V where we assume that the entire structure has a horizontal symmetry plane, and then analyze the longitudinal and transverse wakefields near the system axis. An important symmetry relation for the wake function is established in Sec. VI. In Secs. VII and VIII we present a numerical algorithm for solving equations derived in Sec. II. We describe here in details a new hybrid conformal scheme for structures with walls of finite conductivity. Several numerical examples obtained with the computer code ECHO(2D) are described in Sec. IX. The results of the paper are summarized in Sec. X.  \n  \n II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND FOURIER EXPANSION  \n We consider a bunch of particles moving with the velocity of light $c$ through a metallic structure comprising an incoming pipe, a transition or cavity, and an outgoing pipe, an example of which is shown in Fig. 2. The bunch is characterized by the charge distribution $\\rho$ and the electric current density $j = c \\rho$ . We assume that the bunch is moving along a straight line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the system, and we neglect the influence of the wakefields on the bunch’s motion. Our problem is to find the electric and magnetic fields $E , H$ , in the domain $\\Omega$ which is bounded transversally by metallic walls, defined by the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ of the domain $\\Omega$ . We need to solve Maxwell’s equations with the boundary conditions:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } {  { \\nabla \\times H = \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } D + j , \\quad } } & { \\nabla \\times E = - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } B , } & \\\\ & { \\nabla \\cdot D = \\rho , \\quad } & { \\nabla \\cdot B = 0 , } \\\\ & { B = \\mu H , \\quad } & { D = \\epsilon E , \\quad } & { r \\in \\Omega , } \\\\ & { E ( t = 0 ) = E _ { 0 } , \\quad } & { H ( t = 0 ) = H _ { 0 } , \\quad } & { r \\in \\bar { \\Omega } = \\Omega \\cup \\partial \\Omega , } \\\\ & { \\quad } & { n \\times E = Z _ { s } * ( n \\times H ) , \\quad } & { x \\in \\partial \\Omega , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $E _ { 0 } , H _ { 0 }$ , is an initial electromagnetic field in the domain ${ \\bar { \\Omega } } , n$ is a unit vector normal to the surface $\\partial \\Omega$ , $Z _ { s }$ is a surface impedance and the asterisk means the operation of convolution. While we consider the propagation of beams through vacuum, for the generality of the computational algorithm we included in Eqs. (1) arbitrary dielectric constant $\\epsilon$ and magnetic permittivity $\\mu$ .  \n  \n We choose a coordinate system with $y$ in the vertical and $x$ in the horizontal directions; the $z$ coordinate is directed along the longitudinal axis of the system. The structures considered in this paper have constant width $2 w$ and a fixed location of the perfectly conducting side walls (in the $x$ -direction).  \n The charge density is localized within the interval $0 < x < 2 w$ and vanishes at the ends of the interval, $\\rho ( 0 , y , z ) = \\rho ( 2 w , y , z ) = 0$ . Such a function can be expanded in Fourier series  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } {  { \\rho ( x , y , z ) = \\frac { 1 } { w } \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } \\rho _ { m } ( y , z ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x ) , } } & { \\quad k _ { x , m } = \\frac { \\pi } { 2 w } m , } \\\\ & { } & { \\rho _ { m } ( y , z ) = \\int _ { 0 } ^ { 2 w } \\rho ( x , y , z ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x ) d x . } & { \\quad ( \\mathrm { \\pi } ^ { \\mathrm { \\alpha } } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n It follows from the linearity of Maxwell’s equations, Eqs. (1) and Eq. (2), that the components of electromagnetic field can be represented by infinite sums:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\left( \\begin{array} { l } { H _ { x } } \\\\ { E _ { y } } \\\\ { E _ { z } } \\end{array} \\right) = \\frac { 1 } { w } \\displaystyle \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } \\left( \\begin{array} { l } { H _ { x , m } } \\\\ { E _ { y , m } } \\\\ { E _ { z , m } } \\end{array} \\right) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x ) , } \\\\ & { \\left( \\begin{array} { l } { E _ { x } } \\\\ { H _ { y } } \\\\ { H _ { z } } \\end{array} \\right) = \\frac { 1 } { w } \\displaystyle \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } \\left( \\begin{array} { l } { E _ { x , m } } \\\\ { H _ { y , m } } \\\\ { H _ { z , m } } \\end{array} \\right) \\cos ( k _ { x , m } x ) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n For each mode number $m$ we can write an independent system of equations  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\begin{array} { r l } & { \\delta _ { y } \\pi _ { x x } - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } N _ { x x } } \\\\ & { \\delta _ { y } \\pi _ { y y } - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } \\pi _ { y x } - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial z } N _ { x x } \\operatorname* { d } \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial x } F _ { x x x } ( x ) } \\end{array} } \\\\ & { \\begin{array} { r l } & { \\delta _ { y } \\pi _ { x x } + \\bar { \\kappa } _ { x x } H _ { y } \\bar { R } _ { x x } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { x x } + \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } F _ { x y } \\bar { R } _ { y } \\pi _ { x x } } \\\\ & { - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { x x } H _ { x y } - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } \\bar { R } _ { x x } \\bar { R } _ { y } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { x x } + \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } F _ { x x } \\bar { R } _ { y } } \\end{array} } \\\\ & { \\begin{array} { r l } & { \\delta _ { x } \\pi _ { x x } - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } F _ { x x } \\bar { R } _ { x x } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y } \\bar { R } _ { x x } \\bar { R } _ { x x } } \\\\ & { \\delta _ { y } \\pi _ { x x } - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } F _ { y y } \\bar { R } _ { x x } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y } \\bar { R } _ { x x } \\bar { R } _ { x x } } \\end{array} } \\\\ & { \\begin{array} { r l } & { \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial \\theta } \\bar { F } _ { x y } \\bar { R } _ { x x } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { x x } \\bar { R } _ { x x } \\bar { L } _ { x y } = - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y } \\bar { R } _ { x x } \\bar { L } _ { x y } } \\\\ & { \\delta _ { y } \\pi _ { x x } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { x x } \\bar { L } _ { x y } \\bar { L } _ { x x } = - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y } \\bar { R } _ { x y } \\bar { L } _ { x y } } \\end{array} } \\\\ &  \\begin{array} { r l } & { \\bar { \\kappa } _ { x } \\bar { R } _ { x x } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y y } \\bar { L } _ { x x } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y } \\bar { R } _ { x y } \\bar { L } _ { x x } } \\\\ & { \\bar { \\kappa } _ { x x } \\bar { R } _ { x y } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y y } \\bar { R } _ { x x } - \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y } \\bar { R } _ { x y } \\bar { L } _ { x y } } \\\\ &  \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y y } \\bar { R } _ { y y } \\bar { L } _ { x y } + \\bar { \\kappa } _ { y y } \\bar { R } _ { y y } \\bar { R } _ { x y } + \\bar  \\kappa \\end{array} \\end{array}\n$$ \n Hence we have reduced the 3D problem, Eqs. (1), to an infinite set of independent 2D problems, Eqs. (4). The modal expansion Eqs. (3) was used earlier, for example, in [8,9] for solving Maxwell’s equations in the frequency domain.  \n III. LONGITUDINAL WAKE AS A HARMONIC FUNCTION  \n Let us consider a line-charge beam with vanishing transverse dimensions,  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\rho ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = Q \\delta ( x - x _ { 0 } ) \\delta ( y - y _ { 0 } ) \\lambda ( s ) , } \\\\ & { j _ { z } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = c \\rho ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 }$ , define the transverse offset of the beam, $s =$ $z - c t$ is the local longitudinal coordinate in the bunch, $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ is the bunch charge and $\\lambda ( s )$ is the longitudinal bunch profile [for a point charge, $\\lambda ( s ) = \\delta ( s ) ]$ . The longitudinal wake potential $W _ { \\parallel }$ at point $( x , y , s )$ is defined as [1]  \n $$\nW _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = Q ^ { - 1 } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } [ E _ { z } ( x , y , z , t ) ] _ { t = ( z - s ) / c } d z ,\n$$ \n where the electric field on the right-hand side is the solution to Maxwell’s equation with the sources of Eqs. (5) (this field, of course, is also a function of $x _ { 0 }$ and $y _ { 0 }$ omitted in the arguments of $E _ { z }$ for brevity).  \n It is well known [10] that the longitudinal wake potential satisfies the Laplace equation for the coordinates $x , y$ , of the witness particle  \n $$\n\\left( \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial x ^ { 2 } } + \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial y ^ { 2 } } \\right) W _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = 0 .\n$$ \n In order to express the wake potential in structures of constant width through one-dimensional functions we need to prove that the longitudinal wake potential satisfies also the Laplace equation with respect to the coordinates $x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 }$ , of the source particle. This statement will actually be proven below for arbitrary structures without any restrictions on the structure geometry. The only requirement imposed on the system is that the incoming and outgoing waveguides have perfectly conducting walls.  \n The proof is based on the directional symmetry relation between the wake potential $W _ { \\parallel }$ for the case when the particle travels through the system in the positive $z$ direction, and the wake potential $W _ { \\parallel } ^ { ( - ) }$ corresponding to the case when the particle travels through the same system but in the negative $z$ direction. It was shown in Ref. [11] that the two wake potentials are related by  \n $$\nW _ { \\parallel } ^ { ( - ) } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , s ) - W _ { \\parallel } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } , s ) = 2 c Z _ { e } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } ) \\lambda ( s ) ,\n$$ \n where  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } & { } & { Z _ { e } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } ) = \\frac { \\epsilon _ { 0 } } { c } \\left[ \\displaystyle \\int _ { S _ { A } } d s \\nabla \\phi _ { A } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } ) \\cdot \\nabla \\phi _ { A } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } , \\pmb { r } ) \\right. } \\\\ & { } & { \\qquad \\left. - \\displaystyle \\int _ { S _ { B } } d s \\nabla \\phi _ { B } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } ) \\cdot \\nabla \\phi _ { B } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } , \\pmb { r } ) \\right] , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n $\\epsilon _ { 0 }$ is the permittivity of vacuum, $\\pmb { r } _ { 1 } = ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } )$ and $r _ { 2 } =$ $( x , y )$ are two dimensional vectors, and $\\phi _ { A } , \\phi _ { B }$ , are the Green functions for the Laplacian in the incoming and outgoing pipes with cross-sections, $S _ { A } , S _ { B }$ :  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\Delta \\phi _ { A } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { i } , \\boldsymbol { r } ) = - \\epsilon _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \\delta ( \\boldsymbol { r } - \\boldsymbol { r } _ { i } ) , \\qquad \\boldsymbol { r } \\in S _ { A } , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\phi _ { A } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { i } , \\boldsymbol { r } ) = 0 , \\qquad \\boldsymbol { r } \\in \\partial S _ { A } , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\Delta \\phi _ { B } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { i } , \\boldsymbol { r } ) = - \\epsilon _ { 0 } ^ { - 1 } \\delta ( \\boldsymbol { r } - \\boldsymbol { r } _ { i } ) , \\qquad \\boldsymbol { r } \\in S _ { B } , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\phi _ { B } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { i } , \\boldsymbol { r } ) = 0 , \\qquad \\boldsymbol { r } \\in \\partial S _ { B } , \\qquad i = 1 , 2 , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $\\partial S$ is the boundary of $S$ . Note that $r _ { 1 }$ and $r _ { 2 }$ are offsets of, respectively, the leading and the trailing particles in $W _ { \\parallel }$ , while $r _ { 2 }$ is the offset of the leading particle, and $r _ { 1 }$ is the offset of the trailing particle in $W _ { \\parallel } ^ { ( - ) }$ . Note also that, according to the general property of the wake potentials (7), $W _ { \\parallel } ^ { ( - ) }$ satisfies the Laplace equation  \n $$\n\\left( \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial x _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } + \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial y _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } \\right) W _ { \\parallel } ^ { ( - ) } ( x , y , x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , s ) = 0 .\n$$ \n With the help of Green’s first identity $\\mathbf { \\lambda } _ { n }$ is the outward pointing unit vector normal to the line element $d l$ ),  \n $$\n\\int _ { S } \\nabla f \\cdot \\nabla \\psi d s = \\int _ { \\partial S } f \\partial _ { n } \\psi d l - \\int _ { S } f \\Delta \\psi d s ,\n$$ \n we can rewrite Eq. (8) as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { W _ { \\parallel } ^ { ( - ) } ( { \\pmb r } _ { 2 } , { \\pmb r } _ { 1 } , s ) - W _ { \\parallel } ( { \\pmb r } _ { 1 } , { \\pmb r } _ { 2 } , s ) } } \\\\ { { = 2 \\lambda ( s ) [ \\phi _ { B } ( { \\pmb r } _ { 1 } , { \\pmb r } _ { 2 } ) - \\phi _ { A } ( { \\pmb r } _ { 1 } , { \\pmb r } _ { 2 } ) ] , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where we have used the symmetry of Green’s functions, $\\phi _ { A } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } ) = \\phi _ { A } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } )$ , $\\phi _ { B } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } ) = \\phi _ { B } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } )$ . We now apply the Laplacian operator to the coordinates $x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 }$ in Eq. (12) and use relation (11) to obtain  \n $$\n\\left( \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial x _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } + \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial y _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } \\right) W _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = 0 .\n$$ \n This proves that the wake potential, in addition to being a harmonic function with respect to the coordinates of the trailing particle, is also a harmonic function with respect to the coordinates of the leading particle. To our knowledge, this general property of wakefields has not been previously reported in the literature.  \n  \n IV. WAKE POTENTIAL REPRESENTATION IN STRUCTURES OF CONSTANT WIDTH  \n It is well known [10,12,13] that for rotationally symmetric structures the wake potential can be represented through one dimensional functions, with only one function for each azimuthal mode number $m$ ,  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { W _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = \\displaystyle \\sum _ { m = 0 } ^ { \\infty } W _ { m } ( s ) r _ { 0 } ^ { m } r ^ { m } \\cos [ m ( \\theta - \\theta _ { 0 } ) ] , } } \\\\ { { x _ { 0 } = r _ { 0 } \\cos ( \\theta _ { 0 } ) , \\qquad y _ { 0 } = r _ { 0 } \\sin ( \\theta _ { 0 } ) , } } \\\\ { { x = r \\cos ( \\theta ) , \\qquad y = r \\sin ( \\theta ) . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n As it turns out, a similar, comparably simple representation exists for the wake potential in structures of rectangular cross section and constant width; however, in the latter case four one-dimensional functions are needed for each mode number $m$ .  \n Substituting Eq. (5) into (2) we find for the charge distribution  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { \\displaystyle { \\rho ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = \\frac { 1 } { w } \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } \\rho _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x _ { 0 } ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x ) , } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle { \\rho _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = Q \\delta ( y - y _ { 0 } ) \\lambda ( s ) . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n It then follows from Maxwell’s equations (4) that all components of the fields will be proportional to $\\sin ( k _ { x , m } x _ { 0 } )$ and using Eqs. (3) and (6) we find  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle W _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) } \\ ~ } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle = \\frac { 1 } { w } \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } W _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x _ { 0 } ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x ) } . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n If we insert representation (16) into Eq. (7), we obtain the one-dimesional equation  \n $$\n\\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial y ^ { 2 } } W _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) - ( k _ { x , m } ) ^ { 2 } W _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = 0 ,\n$$ \n which has a general solution of the form  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { W _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = W _ { m } ^ { c } ( y _ { 0 } , s ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y ) } } \\\\ { { + W _ { m } ^ { s } ( y _ { 0 } , s ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y ) . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Finally from Eq. (13) it follows that functions $W _ { m } ^ { c } ( y _ { 0 } , s )$ and $W _ { m } ^ { s } ( y _ { 0 } , s )$ satisfy equations  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial y _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } { \\cal W } _ { m } ^ { c } ( y _ { 0 } , s ) - ( k _ { x , m } ) ^ { 2 } { \\cal W } _ { m } ^ { c } ( y _ { 0 } , s ) = 0 , } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial y _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } { \\cal W } _ { m } ^ { s } ( y _ { 0 } , s ) - ( k _ { x , m } ) ^ { 2 } { \\cal W } _ { m } ^ { s } ( y _ { 0 } , s ) = 0 . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n These equations can again be easily integrated with the result:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle W _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) } \\ ~ } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle = \\frac { 1 } { w } \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } W _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x _ { 0 } ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x ) } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } {  { W _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = [ W _ { m } ^ { c c } ( s ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) } } \\\\ & { } & { ~ + W _ { m } ^ { s c } ( s ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) ] \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y ) } \\\\ & { } & { ~ + [ W _ { m } ^ { c s } ( s ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) } \\\\ & { } & { ~ + W _ { m } ^ { s s } ( s ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) ] \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y ) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Thus, we have proven that, in structures of constant width, for each mode number $m$ four functions are needed to completely describe the longitudinal wake potential. These functions can be calculated as follows  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle { W _ { m } ^ { c c } = W _ { m } ( 0 , 0 , s ) , \\qquad W _ { m } ^ { s c } = \\frac { 1 } { k _ { x , m } } \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } W _ { m } ( 0 , 0 , s ) , } } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle { W _ { m } ^ { c s } = \\frac { 1 } { k _ { x , m } } \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y _ { 0 } } W _ { m } ( 0 , 0 , s ) , } } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle { W _ { m } ^ { s s } = \\frac { 1 } { \\left( k _ { x , m } \\right) ^ { 2 } } \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial y \\partial y _ { 0 } } W _ { m } ( 0 , 0 , s ) , } } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where the $m$ th modal component of the wake potential  \n $$\nW _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = Q ^ { - 1 } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } [ E _ { z , m } ( y , z , t ) ] _ { t = ( z - s ) / c } d z\n$$ \n is excited by a charge distribution that does not depend on $x$ ,  \n $$\n\\rho _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = Q \\delta ( y - y _ { 0 } ) \\lambda ( s ) .\n$$ \n With a knowledge of the longitudinal wake we can calculate the transverse wakes. For example, the vertical wake potential, $W _ { y }$ , can be easily found through the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [10,14],  \n $$\n\\frac { \\partial } { \\partial s } W _ { y } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } W _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) .\n$$ \n In the next section we will analyze both the longitudinal and the transverse wakes assuming that the structure under consideration has a symmetry axis.  \n V. STRUCTURES WITH HORIZONTAL SYMMETRY PLANE  \n Let us consider a structure of constant width $2 w$ that also has a vertical symmetry plane, at $y = 0$ . Structures in Figs. 1(a) and (b) possess this symmetry; hence, they have a symmetry axis located at $x = w , \\ y = 0$ . Due to the symmetry, the wake potential satisfies the equation  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { W _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = W _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , - y _ { 0 } , x , - y , s ) , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n and Eq. (21) simplifies:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } {  { W _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = W _ { m } ^ { c c } ( s ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y ) } } \\\\ & { } & { + W _ { m } ^ { s s } ( s ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y ) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Note that  \n $$\nW _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = W _ { m } ( y , y _ { 0 } , s ) .\n$$ \n Let us consider the transverse wakes in such structures. We first introduce the integrated wake functions (sometimes called the step function response)  \n $$\nS _ { m } ^ { c c } = \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { s } W _ { m } ^ { c c } ( s ^ { \\prime } ) d s ^ { \\prime } , \\qquad S _ { m } ^ { s s } = \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { s } W _ { m } ^ { s s } ( s ^ { \\prime } ) d s ^ { \\prime } .\n$$ \n It then follows from (25) that the transverse wake function can be written as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle { \\cal W } _ { y } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) } \\ ~ } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle ~ = \\frac { 1 } { w } \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } k _ { x , m } { \\cal W } _ { y , m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x _ { 0 } ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x ) } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle { \\cal W } _ { x } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) } \\ ~ } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle = \\frac { 1 } { w } \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } k _ { x , m } { \\cal W } _ { x , m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) \\sin ( k _ { x , m } x _ { 0 } ) \\cos ( k _ { x , m } x ) } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { W _ { y , m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = S _ { m } ^ { c c } ( s ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y ) } \\\\ & { \\qquad + S _ { m } ^ { s s } ( s ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y ) , } \\\\ & { W _ { x , m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = S _ { m } ^ { c c } ( s ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) \\cosh ( k _ { x , m } y ) } \\\\ & { \\qquad + S _ { m } ^ { s s } ( s ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y _ { 0 } ) \\sinh ( k _ { x , m } y ) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Representations (30), (31), are valid for arbitrary offsets of leading and trailing particles.  \n For small offsets near the symmetry axis, $x = w , y = 0 .$ , the transverse wake potential is usually expanded in Taylor series,  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { W _ { y } ( w , y _ { 0 } , w , y , s ) \\approx y _ { 0 } \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y _ { 0 } } W _ { y } ( w , y _ { 0 } , w , 0 , s ) | _ { y _ { 0 } = 0 } } \\\\ { + y \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } W _ { y } ( w , 0 , w , y , s ) | _ { y = 0 } . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The first term in (32) is usually called the transverse dipole wake in the $y$ -direction. It can be calculated as follows  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle W _ { y , d } ( s ) \\equiv \\frac \\partial { \\partial y _ { 0 } } W _ { y } \\big ( w , y _ { 0 } , w , 0 , s \\big ) \\big \\vert _ { y _ { 0 } = 0 } } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle \\quad = \\frac 1 { w } \\sum _ { m = 1 , \\mathrm { o d d } } ^ { \\infty } ( k _ { x , m } ) ^ { 2 } S _ { m } ^ { s s } ( s ) . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The second term in (32) is called the transverse quadrupole wake in $y$ -direction; it is obtained by  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } & { } & { W _ { y , q } ( s ) \\equiv \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial y } W _ { x } ( w , 0 , w , y , s ) \\big \\vert _ { y = 0 } } \\\\ & { } & { \\qquad = \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { w } \\sum _ { m = 1 , \\mathrm { o d d } } ^ { \\infty } ( k _ { x , m } ) ^ { 2 } S _ { m } ^ { c c } ( s ) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The transverse wakes in the $x$ direction are obtained by equations corresponding to those of Eqs. (33), (34). Note that $W _ { y , q } ( s ) = - W _ { x , q } ( s )$ .  \n In numerical calculations of structures with symmetry we can use the approach of paper [15] that allows us to reduce the calculation domain in half. Indeed the charge distribution (24) can be written as a sum of symmetric and antisymmetric parts  \n $$\n\\rho _ { m } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = \\rho _ { m } ^ { E } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) + \\rho _ { m } ^ { H } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) ,\n$$ \n where  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle { \\rho _ { m } ^ { H } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } Q [ \\delta ( y - y _ { 0 } ) + \\delta ( y + y _ { 0 } ) ] \\lambda ( s ) , } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle { } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle { \\rho _ { m } ^ { E } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } Q [ \\delta ( y - y _ { 0 } ) - \\delta ( y + y _ { 0 } ) ] \\lambda ( s ) . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n In problems with the symmetric driving charges (36), the tangential component of the magnetic field will be zero in the symmetry plane (the so-called “magnetic” boundary condition). In problems with the antisymmetric driving charges (37) the tangential component of the electric field will be zero in the symmetry plane (the “electric” boundary condition). Thus, instead of solving the system of equations (4) in the whole domain, one can solve two independent problems in half of the domain: one problem with the “magnetic” boundary condition at $y = 0$ and one problem with the “electric” boundary condition at $y = 0$ . This is true not only for the linecharge current distribution (5), but for any arbitrary three dimensional charge distribution $\\rho ( x , y , z , t )$ . From solutions $W _ { m } ^ { H } \\big ( y _ { 0 } , y , s \\big )$ and $W _ { m } ^ { E } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s )$ of the two problems we can easily find the one dimensional modal functions in Eq. (27):  \n $$\nW _ { m } ^ { c c } ( s ) = W _ { m } ^ { H } ( 0 , 0 , s ) .\n$$ \n $$\nW _ { m } ^ { s s } ( s ) = ( k _ { x , m } ) ^ { - 2 } \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } } { \\partial y _ { 0 } \\partial y } W _ { m } ^ { E } ( y _ { 0 } , y , s ) | _ { y , y _ { 0 } = 0 } .\n$$ \n VI. SYMMETRY RELATIONS FOR THE TRANSVERSE WAKE POTENTIAL  \n In the general case, from the directional symmetry relation, Eqs. (8), discussed in Sec. III, one cannot immediately infer the corresponding symmetry for the transverse wakes taken in the positive and negative directions. It turns out, however, that for structures of constant width with a symmetry axis, such a directional symmetry relation for the transverse wake potential can be proven. Indeed, from the symmetry relation (28) and Eq. (20) follows the symmetry of the longitudinal wake potential,  \n $$\nW _ { \\parallel } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y , s ) = W _ { \\parallel } ( x , y , x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , s ) .\n$$ \n Hence the directional symmetry relation (12) for the longitudinal wake potential can now be written as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { W _ { \\parallel } ^ { ( - ) } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } , s ) - W _ { \\parallel } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } , s ) } \\\\ & { \\quad = 2 \\lambda ( s ) [ \\phi _ { B } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } ) - \\phi _ { A } ( \\pmb { r } _ { 1 } , \\pmb { r } _ { 2 } ) ] ; } \\end{array}\n$$ \n and from the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem (25) it follows that  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\quad W _ { \\perp } ^ { ( - ) } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { 1 } , \\boldsymbol { r } _ { 2 } , s ) - W _ { \\perp } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { 1 } , \\boldsymbol { r } _ { 2 } , s ) } \\\\ & { \\quad \\quad \\quad = 2 \\Lambda ( s ) [ \\nabla \\phi _ { B } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { 1 } , \\boldsymbol { r } _ { 2 } ) - \\nabla \\phi _ { A } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { 1 } , \\boldsymbol { r } _ { 2 } ) ] , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\quad \\Lambda ( s ) = \\displaystyle \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { s } \\lambda ( s ^ { \\prime } ) d s ^ { \\prime } . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n In the last equation we have used the vectorial notation for the transverse wake, $\\pmb { W } _ { \\perp } = ( W _ { x } , W _ { y } )$ .  \n Let us now calculate the directional relation for the dipole and quadrupole wakes defined by Eqs. (33), (34). Denote the vertical aperture of the incoming rectangular pipe by $2 g _ { A }$ and that of the outgoing pipe $2 g _ { B }$ . (Both pipes have the same width $2 w$ .) The Green function for Poisson’s equation in a rectangular pipe, $\\phi _ { A } ( x _ { 0 } , y _ { 0 } , x , y )$ , has been obtained by Gluckstern et al. [16]. For $x _ { 0 } = w$ , their result reads :  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle - \\frac { 1 } { \\pi \\epsilon _ { 0 } } \\sum _ { n = 1 } ^ { \\infty } \\frac { e ^ { - \\frac { n \\pi } { 2 g _ { A } } } \\cosh \\frac { n \\pi ( x - w ) } { 2 g } } { n \\cosh \\frac { n \\pi w } { 2 g _ { A } } } \\sin \\frac { n \\pi } { 2 g } ( y + g _ { A } ) \\sin \\frac { n \\pi } { 2 g } ( y _ { 0 } + g _ { A } ) } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle + \\ln \\left. [ ( x - w ) ^ { 2 } + ( y - y _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 } ] \\frac { \\sinh ^ { 2 } \\frac { \\pi ( x - w ) } { 4 g _ { A } } } { \\sinh ^ { 2 } \\frac { \\pi ( x - w ) } { 4 g _ { A } } } + \\cos ^ { 2 } \\frac { \\pi } { 4 g _ { A } } ( y + y _ { 0 } ) \\right. } - \\ln [ ( x - w ) ^ { 2 } + ( y - y _ { 0 } ) ^ { 2 } ] . }  \\end{array}\n$$ \n The last term is singular in the limit $x \\to w$ and $y  y _ { 0 }$ . All other terms are finite for all admissible $x$ and $y$ , and the sum in the first term rapidly converges. The Green’s function of the outgoing pipe, $\\phi _ { B } ( w , y _ { 0 } , x , y )$ , is obtained from (42) by replacing $g _ { A }  g _ { B }$ . It is then easy to see that the singular terms cancel in the difference $\\phi _ { A } - \\phi _ { B }$ ; hence this function is finite within the domain of its definition. If we follow the approach of paper [17] and use Eqs. (39), (40), (45) from that paper, then from Eq. (41) our final result reads  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { W _ { y , d } ^ { ( - ) } ( s ) - W _ { y , d } ( s ) = 2 c \\Lambda ( s ) [ Z _ { y , d } ( g _ { A } ) - Z _ { y , d } ( g _ { B } ) ] , } } \\\\ { { W _ { y , q } ^ { ( - ) } ( s ) - W _ { y , q } ( s ) = 2 c \\Lambda ( s ) [ Z _ { y , q } ( g _ { A } ) - Z _ { y , q } ( g _ { B } ) ] , } } \\\\ { { Z _ { y , d } ( g ) = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\pi Z _ { 0 } } { 1 2 g ^ { 2 } } \\left[ 1 + 2 4 \\displaystyle \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } \\displaystyle \\frac { m } { 1 + e ^ { 2 \\pi m ( w / g ) } } \\right] , } } \\\\ { { Z _ { y , q } ( g ) = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\pi Z _ { 0 } } { 2 4 g ^ { 2 } } \\left[ 1 - 2 4 \\displaystyle \\sum _ { m = 1 } ^ { \\infty } \\displaystyle \\frac { 2 m - 1 } { 1 + e ^ { \\pi ( 2 m - 1 ) ( w / g ) } } \\right] . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n VII. TE/TM SCHEME IN MATRIX NOTATION  \n In this section we describe a particular realization of the implicit TE/TM scheme introduced in [6]. The scheme will be discussed in the context of the finite integration technique [18].  \n We will consider Maxwell’s equations in their integral form on a domain $\\Omega$ with the linear nondispersive constitutive relations:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\displaystyle { \\oint _ { s } E d l } = - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } \\frac { \\iint _ { B } } { s } B d s , } \\\\ & { \\displaystyle { \\oint _ { s } { H d l } } = \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } \\bigoplus _ { { D } } d s + \\oint _ { s } ^ { \\infty } j d s , \\quad \\forall s \\subset \\Omega , } \\\\ & { \\displaystyle { \\iint _ { { D } } d s } = \\frac { \\langle H ^ { 2 } ( e ) , \\quad \\langle \\stackrel { d } { \\partial } \\rangle } { \\underset { \\underbrace { V } } { \\underbrace { \\mathrm { d } \\langle { \\partial } \\psi } } } , \\qquad \\int _ { \\psi } ^ { \\infty } d s = 0 , \\quad \\forall V \\subset \\Omega , } \\\\ & { \\displaystyle { D } = \\epsilon E , \\qquad B = \\mu H , \\quad \\forall s \\in \\Omega . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Let us start by introducing a grid-based decomposition of the entire computation domain $\\Omega$ into cell complex $G$ . We use here a three dimensional Cartesian mesh in $x , y , z$ coordinates, with the corresponding indexing $( i , j , k )$ . Unlike in finite-difference methods where one starts by allocating the field components, we begin by taking the voltage along cell edges and the magnetic flux through cell facets as the computational unknowns:  \n  \n $$\ne _ { \\vartheta } = \\int _ { L _ { \\vartheta } } E d l , \\qquad b _ { \\vartheta } = \\int \\int _ { S _ { \\vartheta } } \\pmb { B } d s ,\n$$ \n where $\\vartheta$ is a mesh multi-index and $L _ { \\vartheta } , S _ { \\vartheta } \\in G$ . Solving Faraday’s law in integral form for the front surface shown in Fig. 3 yields:  \n $$\n- e _ { x } ^ { ( i , j , k ) } + e _ { y } ^ { ( i , j , k ) } + e _ { x } ^ { ( i , j + 1 , k ) } - e _ { y } ^ { ( i + 1 , j , k ) } = - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } b _ { z } ^ { ( i , j , k ) } .\n$$ \n Note, that this representation is still exact, as $\\scriptstyle e _ { \\vartheta }$ is (by definition) the exact electric voltage along one edge of the cell, and similarly $b _ { \\vartheta }$ represents the exact value of the magnetic flux density integral over the cell surface. If we compose column vectors  \n $$\ne = \\left( { \\begin{array} { l } { e _ { x } } \\\\ { e _ { y } } \\\\ { e _ { z } } \\end{array} } \\right) , \\qquad b = \\left( { \\begin{array} { l } { b _ { x } } \\\\ { b _ { y } } \\\\ { b _ { z } } \\end{array} } \\right)\n$$ \n from all voltage and flux components, we can write the combination of all equations over all surfaces in an elegant matrix form as  \n $$\n\\mathbf { C e } = - { \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } } \\mathbf { b } .\n$$ \n The matrix $\\mathbf { C }$ picks the affected components out of the long vector to make up the corresponding equation. $\\mathbf { C }$ is thus the discrete curl operator over the mesh $G$ . With an appropriate indexing scheme the curl matrix has a $3 \\times 3$ block structure:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\mathbf { C } = \\left( \\begin{array} { c c c } { \\mathbf { 0 } } & { - \\mathbf { P } _ { z } } & { \\mathbf { P } _ { y } } \\\\ { \\mathbf { P } _ { z } } & { \\mathbf { 0 } } & { - \\mathbf { P } _ { x } } \\\\ { - \\mathbf { P } _ { y } } & { \\mathbf { P } _ { x } } & { \\mathbf { 0 } } \\end{array} \\right) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The double-banded, topological $\\mathbf { P } _ { x } , \\mathbf { P } _ { y } , \\mathbf { P } _ { z }$ -matrices take the role of discrete partial differential operators.  \n The second important differential operator in Maxwell’s equations (1) is the divergence operator. In order to construct a discrete divergence operator we integrate Maxwell’s equation $\\oint _ { \\partial V } { \\cal B } d { \\bf s } = 0$ over the entire surface of a mesh cell depi ted in Fig. 3. By adding up the six fluxes for each cell and by writing down all such equations for the entire mesh we obtain a discrete analogue to the divergence equation:  \n  \n $$\n\\mathbf { S } \\mathbf { b } = \\mathbf { 0 } , \\qquad \\mathbf { S } = ( \\mathbf { P } _ { x } \\mathbf { P } _ { y } \\mathbf { P } _ { z } ) .\n$$ \n The discretization of the remaining Maxwell equations requires the introduction of a second cell complex $G$ which is dual to the primary cell complex $G$ . For the Cartesian grid the dual complex $\\tilde { G }$ is defined by taking the foci of the cells of $G$ as gridpoints for the mesh cells of $\\tilde { G }$ . We again introduce the computational unknowns as integrals  \n $$\nh _ { \\vartheta } = \\int _ { \\tilde { L } _ { \\vartheta } } H d l , d _ { \\vartheta } = \\int \\int _ { \\tilde { S } _ { \\vartheta } } D d s , j _ { \\vartheta } = \\int \\int _ { \\tilde { S } _ { \\vartheta } } \\mathbf { j } d s ,\n$$ \n where $\\vartheta$ is a mesh multi-index and $\\tilde { L } _ { \\vartheta } , \\tilde { S } _ { \\vartheta } \\in \\tilde { G }$ .  \n Following an equivalent procedure for the remaining Maxwell’s equations, but using the dual cell complex $\\tilde { G }$ , we obtain a set of four discrete equations representing Maxwell’s equations on grid:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle { \\bf C } { \\bf e } = - \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } { \\bf b } , \\qquad { \\bf C } { \\bf \\ddot { \\bf \\bf \\ddot { \\bf \\Phi } h } } = \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial t } { \\bf d } + { \\bf j } , } \\ ~ } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle { \\bf S } { \\bf b } = { \\bf 0 } , \\qquad { \\bf \\tilde { S } d } = { \\bf q } , \\qquad { \\bf e } , { \\bf b } \\in G } , \\qquad { \\bf h } , { \\bf d } \\in \\tilde { G } , \\ ~ } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle { \\bf \\tilde { \\bf S } } = ( - { \\bf P } _ { x } ^ { * } - { \\bf P } _ { y } ^ { * } - { \\bf P } _ { z } ^ { * } ) } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where the asterisk denotes the Hermetian adjoint operator.  \n Equations (51) are completed by the discrete form of the material relations (constitutive equations) which appear (in the simplest linear case) as matrix equations  \n $$\n\\mathbf { e } = c \\mathbf { M } _ { \\epsilon ^ { - 1 } } \\mathbf { d } , \\qquad \\mathbf { h } = c \\mathbf { M } _ { \\mu ^ { - 1 } } \\mathbf { b } .\n$$ \n with ${ \\bf M } _ { \\epsilon ^ { - 1 } }$ the discrete inverse permittivity matrix, and ${ \\bf M } _ { \\mu ^ { - 1 } }$ the inverse permeability matrix.  \n In the case of Cartesian grids (or, more generally, whenever the primary and dual grids are orthogonal) all material operators can be represented by diagonal matrices. Note that the material matrices contain both averaged material parameters, and the lengths and areas of the grid edges and faces, respectively. In the standard staircase approximation the material matrices contain elements (without double indices for simplicity of notation)  \n  \n $$\n\\epsilon _ { p i j k } ^ { - 1 } = ( c \\epsilon ) ^ { - 1 } \\frac { L _ { p i j k } } { \\tilde { S } _ { p i j k } } , \\qquad \\mu _ { p i j k } ^ { - 1 } = ( c \\mu ) ^ { - 1 } \\frac { S _ { p i j k } } { \\tilde { L } _ { p i j k } } ,\n$$ \n with $p = x , y , z$ , and the face areas and edge lengths of the primary and secondary grid given by $S , L , { \\tilde { S } } , { \\tilde { L } } .$ , respectively.  \n In the conformal scheme [19], we allow the cells of the computational grid to be only partially filled by a perfectly  \n electric conducting (PEC) material and with an arbitrarily shaped interface. To model such a case we modify only the elements of the material matrices:  \n $$\n( \\epsilon _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { ( i , j , k ) } = ( c \\epsilon ) ^ { - 1 } \\frac { l _ { p } ^ { ( i , j , k ) } } { \\tilde { S } _ { p } ^ { ( i , j , k ) } } , \\quad ( \\mu _ { p } ^ { - 1 } ) ^ { ( i , j , k ) } = ( c \\mu ) ^ { - 1 } \\frac { s _ { p } ^ { ( i , j , k ) } } { \\tilde { L } _ { p } ^ { ( i , j , k ) } } ,\n$$ \n where $s , l$ denote the reduced cell areas and lengths, including only those parts inside the computational domain (outside PEC material), as shown in Fig. 4.  \n The complete set of equations (51) and (52) is referred to as Maxwell’s grid equations.  \n For our 2D rectangular structures, Maxwell’s equations (1) reduce to the modal equations (4). In addition, the dual three-dimensional cell complex $( G , { \\tilde { G } } )$ reduces to the two-dimensional plane complex shown in Fig. 5. In Maxwell’s grid equations the discrete operator ${ \\bf P } _ { x }$ reduces to the diagonal matrix $\\mathbf { k } _ { x , m } = k _ { x , m } \\mathbf { I }$ , where $\\textbf { I }$ is the unit matrix.  \n System (51) is a time-continuous and space-discrete approximation of problem (4). The next step is a discretization of the system in time. The field components can be split in time and the leap-frog method can be applied. With “electric/magnetic” splitting, a well-known Yee’s scheme [20] will be obtained. However Yee’s scheme has large dispersion errors along the grid lines. In the following we consider an alternative TE/TM splitting scheme [6], one that does not have dispersion errors in the longitudinal direction.  \n Let us rewrite Eqs. (51) in an equivalent form  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial \\tau } \\mathbf { u } = \\mathbf { M } _ { \\mathbf { u } } ( \\mathbf { T } _ { \\mathbf { u } } \\mathbf { u } + \\mathbf { L } \\mathbf { v } -

\\alpha ^ { 2 } ( \\Delta z ) ^ { - 2 } \\mathbf P _ { z } \\mathbf P _ { z } ^ { * } > 0 .\n$$ \n This last condition resembles the well-known stability condition of the explicit finite-difference time domain (FDTD) scheme for one-dimensional problems. The maximal eigenvalue of the discrete operator $\\mathbf { P } _ { z } \\mathbf { P } _ { z } ^ { * }$ fulfills the relation $\\lambda _ { \\operatorname* { m a x } } < 4$ , and the stability condition of the scheme in the staircase approximation of the boundary in vacuum reads  \n  \n $$\n\\Delta \\tau \\leq \\Delta z .\n$$ \n On an equidistant mesh the implicit scheme (57) has a second order local approximation error in homogeneous regions.  \n Relation (63) does not contain information about the transverse mesh. Hence the transverse mesh can be chosen independent of stability considerations. Following the conventional procedure [6], the dispersion relation can be obtained in the form  \n $$\n\\left( \\frac { \\sin \\Omega } { \\Delta \\tau } \\right) ^ { 2 } = \\left( \\frac { \\sin K _ { z } } { \\Delta z } \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\left( \\frac { \\sin K _ { y } } { \\Delta y } \\cos \\Omega \\right) ^ { 2 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\Omega = 0 . 5 \\omega \\Delta \\tau$ , $K _ { y } = 0 . 5 k _ { y } \\Delta y$ , $K _ { z } = 0 . 5 k _ { z } \\Delta x$ . With the “magic” time step $\\Delta \\tau = \\Delta z$ , the scheme does not have dispersion in the longitudinal direction.  \n Following the approach of [6] it is easy to show that charge conservation holds:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } {  { \\frac { \\mathbf { g } _ { e } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } - \\mathbf { g } _ { e } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } } { \\Delta \\tau } + \\tilde { \\mathbf { S } } \\tilde { \\mathbf { j } } ^ { n } = \\mathbf { 0 } , } } & { \\frac { \\mathbf { g } _ { h } ^ { n + 1 } - \\mathbf { g } _ { h } ^ { n } } { \\Delta \\tau } = \\mathbf { 0 } , } & \\\\ & { } & { \\mathbf { g } _ { e } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = \\tilde { \\mathbf { S } } \\mathbf { M } _ { \\epsilon ^ { - 1 } } ^ { - 1 } \\bar { \\mathbf { e } } _ { z } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , \\qquad \\mathbf { g } _ { h } ^ { n } = \\mathbf { S } \\mathbf { M } _ { \\mu ^ { - 1 } } ^ { - 1 } \\bar { \\mathbf { h } } _ { z } ^ { n } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where functions with overbars are defined as  \n $$\n\\bar { \\mathbf { f } } ^ { n } = [ 0 . 5 ( \\mathbf { f } _ { x } ^ { n + 1 } + \\mathbf { f } _ { x } ^ { n } ) , 0 . 5 ( \\mathbf { f } _ { y } ^ { n + 1 } + \\mathbf { f } _ { y } ^ { n } ) , \\mathbf { f } _ { z } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ] ^ { T } .\n$$ \n VIII. HYBRID CONFORMAL TE/TM SCHEME FOR CONDUCTIVE WALLS  \n In the previous section we have described in matrix notation the conformal scheme for perfectly conducting boundaries. However, in order to use the Fourier expansion (3), it is sufficient to require only that the walls at $x = 0$ and $x = 2 w$ be perfectly conducting. The bottom and top walls of the structure can have different boundary conditions. In the following we will introduce a conformal scheme for metallic walls with finite conductivity. “Conformal” means here a better description of material interfaces in order to reduce approximation errors and to improve the convergence [22]. To simplify the discussion we will switch to the component notation.  \n For the case of rotationally symmetric geometry and usage of the “staircase” approximation for the boundaries a similar scheme was described in [23]. However the staircase scheme provides only first order convergence. Attempts of authors [23] at that time to suggest and to implement a conformal scheme (with second order convergence) have failed due to instabilities of the scheme for the maximal time step required for “dispersion-free” propagation. The conformal scheme described below shows the second order convergence and the stability.  \n  \n We consider the case of high conductivity $\\kappa$ when only tangential components of the field propagate in the metal. For example, for the Gaussian bunch with rms length $\\sigma _ { z }$ this condition is fulfilled if  \n $$\n\\kappa \\sigma _ { z } \\gg \\epsilon _ { 0 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\epsilon _ { 0 }$ is electric permittivity of the vacuum. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that at the boundary cells there are two tangential components of the electric field which should be updated at each time step. The continuous form of the update equations in the local system of coordinates ( $\\scriptstyle { \\ ' } t$ -tangential vector in $y z$ -plane and $\\pmb { p }$ —the vector normal to $y z$ -plane) reads  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { Z _ { 0 } } \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial \\tau } E _ { t } + \\kappa E _ { t } = \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial s } H _ { p } , } \\\\ { \\displaystyle Z _ { 0 } \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial \\tau } H _ { p } = \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial s } E _ { t } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { Z _ { 0 } } \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial \\tau } E _ { p } + \\kappa E _ { p } = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial s } H _ { t } , } \\\\ { Z _ { 0 } \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial \\tau } H _ { t } = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial } { \\partial s } E _ { p } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $s$ is a distance along the conductive line (see Fig. 6). A detailed discussion of this approximation and its equivalence to the surface impedance boundary condition can be found in [19,23].  \n Let us suggest that the field components in vacuum are known and consider the updates of tangential components of the electric field at the boundary. A boundary cell together with the field components is shown in Fig. 6.  \n The systems of equations (65) and (66) are decoupled. System (65) can be approximated as follows (to simplify the notation we omit indices $( i , j )$ of the boundary cell under consideration)  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\quad \\tilde { h } _ { p , 0 } ^ { n } = l _ { c } h _ { x } ^ { n } , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\tilde { h } _ { p , k } ^ { n } = h _ { p , k } ^ { n - 1 0 . 5 } + \\frac { \\Delta \\tau } { 2 \\Delta x \\zeta _ { 0 } } ( e _ { t , k } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } - e _ { t , k - 1 } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } ) , \\quad k = 1 , 2 , \\dots , N , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\quad ( 1 + 2 d ) \\tilde { e } _ { t , k } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } + d ( \\tilde { e } _ { t , k - 1 } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } + \\tilde { e } _ { t , k + 1 } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ) } \\\\ & { \\quad \\quad \\quad = ( a - 1 ) e _ { t , k } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + b ( \\tilde { h } _ { p , k + 1 } ^ { n } - \\tilde { h } _ { p , k } ^ { n } ) , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\quad e _ { t , k } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = e _ { t , k } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + \\tilde { e } _ { t , k } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , \\quad k = 1 , 2 , \\dots , N - 1 , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\quad h _ { p , k } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = \\tilde { h } _ { p , k } ^ { n } + \\frac { \\Delta \\tau } { 2 \\Delta x \\zeta _ { 0 } } ( e _ { t , k } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } - e _ { t , k - 1 } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ) , \\quad k = 1 , 2 , \\dots , N , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $N$ is the number of mesh points at the conducting line and  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle { a = e ^ { - \\tilde { \\kappa } \\Delta \\tau } , \\qquad b = \\frac { 1 - a } { \\tilde { \\kappa } \\Delta s } , \\qquad d = \\frac { \\Delta \\tau } { 2 \\Delta s } b , } } \\\\ { \\Delta s = 2 \\sqrt { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\Delta \\tau } { \\tilde { \\kappa } } } , \\qquad \\tilde { \\kappa } = Z _ { 0 } \\kappa . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n To close the system of equations (67) we impose on field component $E _ { t }$ the Dirichlet boundary condition at the end of the “wire,” $e _ { t , N } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = 0$ , and introduce the update equation at the material interface  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } { ( 1 + d ) \\tilde { e } _ { t , 0 } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } + d \\tilde { e } _ { t , 1 } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = ( a _ { 0 } - 1 ) e _ { t , 0 } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + b _ { 0 } ( \\tilde { h } _ { p , 1 } ^ { n } - \\tilde { h } _ { p , 0 } ^ { n } ) , ~ } & { } \\\\ { e _ { t , 0 } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = e _ { t , 0 } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + \\tilde { e } _ { t , 0 } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , ~ } & { } \\\\ { a _ { 0 } = e ^ { - 0 . 5 \\tilde { \\kappa } \\Delta \\tau } , ~ b _ { 0 } = 2 \\frac { 1 - a _ { 0 } } { \\tilde { \\kappa } \\Delta s } . ~ } & { ( 6 } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Equations (67)–(69) provide the second order local approximation of continuous equations (65) and define the map  \n $$\nM _ { t } ^ { n } \\colon ( \\mathbf { h } _ { x } ^ { n } , \\mathbf { e } _ { t } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf { h } _ { p } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } ) \\to ( \\mathbf { e } _ { t } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf { h } _ { p } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ) .\n$$ \n In order to approximate the second system (66) we need to calculate first the tangential component of the magnetic field \\~htð;i;0jÞ;n. From geometric arguments (see Fig. 4) the following equation follows  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\widetilde { h } _ { t , 0 } ^ { ( i , j ) } = \\frac { l _ { y } ^ { ( i , j ) } h _ { z } ^ { ( i , j ) } + l _ { y } ^ { ( i + 1 , j ) } h _ { z } ^ { ( i + 1 , j ) } } { 2 \\Delta y \\Delta z } t _ { z } ^ { ( i , j ) } } \\\\ { + \\frac { l _ { z } ^ { ( i , j ) } h _ { y } ^ { ( i , j ) } + l _ { z } ^ { ( i , j + 1 ) } h _ { y } ^ { ( i , j + 1 ) } } { 2 \\Delta y \\Delta z } t _ { y } ^ { ( i , j ) } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $( t _ { z } ^ { ( i , j ) } , t _ { y } ^ { ( i , j ) } )$ are components of the tangential vector $\\pmb { t } ^ { ( i , j ) }$ for the part of the conductive boundary in the cell with multi-index $( i , j )$ .  \n The update algorithm for components $\\pmb { e } _ { p } , \\pmb { h } _ { t }$ has exactly the same form as equations (67)–(69) with corresponding change in the notation. Hence the second map is defined as well  \n $$\nM _ { p } ^ { n } \\colon ( \\mathbf { h } _ { y } ^ { n } , \\mathbf { h } _ { z } ^ { n } , \\mathbf { e } _ { p } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf { h } _ { t } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } )  ( \\mathbf { e } _ { p } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf { h } _ { t } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ) .\n$$ \n Now we are able to formulate the hybrid algorithm. The field components $\\mathbf h _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf h _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf e _ { z } ^ { n + 0 . 5 }$ at time level $n + 0 . 5$ can be found as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { x } ^ { n } = \\mathbf { h } _ { x } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + \\alpha \\mathbf { M } _ { \\vartheta _ { x } ^ { n - 1 } } \\vert \\mathbf { P } _ { z } \\mathbf { e } _ { y } ^ { n } - \\mathbf { P } _ { y } \\mathbf { e } _ { z } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + \\mathbf { e } _ { t , 0 } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } \\vert , } \\\\ & { \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { y } ^ { n } = \\mathbf { h } _ { y } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + \\alpha \\mathbf { M } _ { \\theta _ { y } ^ { n - 1 } } \\vert - \\mathbf { P } _ { z } \\mathbf { e } _ { x } ^ { n } + k _ { x , m } \\mathbf { e } _ { z } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + \\mathbf { e } _ { p , 0 } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } \\vert , } \\\\ & { M _ { \\sigma } ^ { n } : ( \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { x } ^ { n } , \\mathbf { e } _ { t } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf { h } _ { p } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } )  ( \\mathbf { e } _ { u } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf { h } _ { p } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ) , } \\\\ & { M _ { p } ^ { n } : ( \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { y } ^ { n } , \\mathbf { h } _ { z } ^ { n } , \\mathbf { e } _ { p } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf { h } _ { t } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } )  ( \\mathbf { e } _ { p } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } , \\mathbf { h } _ { t } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ) , } \\\\ & { \\mathbf { e } _ { z } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = \\mathbf { e } _ { z } ^ { n - 0 . 5 } + 2 \\alpha \\mathbf { W } _ { e } ^ { - 1 } \\mathbf { M } _ { e _ { z } ^ { n - 1 } } [ - k _ { x , m } \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { y } ^ { n } + \\mathbf { P } _ { y } ^ { - 1 } \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { x } ^ { n } - \\mathbf { j } _ { z } ^ { n } ] , } \\\\ & { \\mathbf { h } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { x } ^ { n } + \\alpha \\mathbf { M } _ { \\theta _ { z } ^ { n - 1 } } [ \\mathbf { P } _ { z } \\mathbf { e } _ { x } ^ { n } - \\mathbf { P } _ { y } \\mathbf { e } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } + \\mathbf { e } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ] } \\\\ &  \\mathbf { h } _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { y } ^ { n } + \\alpha \\mathbf { M } _ { \\theta _ { y } ^ { n - 1 } } [ \\mathbf { P } _ { z } \\mathbf { e }  \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $\\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { x } ^ { n } , \\tilde { \\mathbf { h } } _ { y } ^ { n }$ are auxiliary vectors and operator matrix ${ \\mathbf W } _ { e }$ is a sparse one,  \n $$\n\\mathbf { W } _ { e } = \\mathbf { I } + \\alpha ^ { 2 } [ ( k _ { x , m } ) ^ { 2 } \\mathbf { M } _ { \\epsilon _ { z } ^ { - 1 } } \\mathbf { M } _ { \\mu _ { y } ^ { - 1 } } + \\mathbf { M } _ { \\epsilon _ { z } ^ { - 1 } } \\mathbf { P } _ { y } ^ { * } \\mathbf { M } _ { \\mu _ { x } ^ { - 1 } } \\mathbf { P } _ { y } ] .\n$$ \n The field components $\\mathbf e _ { x } ^ { n + 1 } , \\mathbf e _ { y } ^ { n + 1 } , \\mathbf h _ { z } ^ { n + 1 }$ at time level $n + 1$ can be found as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\tilde { \\mathbf { e } } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = \\mathbf { e } _ { x } ^ { n } + \\alpha \\mathbf { M } _ { \\epsilon _ { x } ^ { - 1 } } [ \\mathbf { P } _ { z } ^ { * } \\mathbf { h } _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } - \\mathbf { P } _ { y } ^ { * } \\mathbf { h } _ { z } ^ { n } - \\mathbf { j } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ] , } \\\\ & { \\tilde { \\mathbf { e } } _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } = \\mathbf { e } _ { y } ^ { n } + \\alpha \\mathbf { M } _ { \\epsilon _ { y } ^ { - 1 } } [ \\mathbf { P } _ { z } ^ { * } \\mathbf { h } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } - k _ { x , m } \\mathbf { h } _ { z } ^ { n } - \\mathbf { j } _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ] , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\mathbf { h } _ { z } ^ { n + 1 } = \\mathbf { h } _ { z } ^ { n } + 2 \\alpha \\mathbf { W } _ { h } ^ { - 1 } \\mathbf { M } _ { \\mu _ { z } ^ { - 1 } } [ - k _ { x , m } \\tilde { \\mathbf { e } } _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } + \\mathbf { P } _ { y } \\tilde { \\mathbf { e } } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } + \\mathbf { e } _ { p , 0 } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ] , } \\\\ & { \\quad \\mathbf { e } _ { x } ^ { n + 1 } = \\tilde { \\mathbf { e } } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } + \\alpha \\mathbf { M } _ { \\epsilon _ { x } ^ { - 1 } } [ \\mathbf { P } _ { z } ^ { * } \\mathbf { h } _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } - \\mathbf { P } _ { y } ^ { * } \\mathbf { h } _ { z } ^ { n + 1 } - \\mathbf { j } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ] } \\\\ & { \\quad \\mathbf { e } _ { y } ^ { n + 1 } = \\tilde { \\mathbf { e } } _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } + \\alpha \\mathbf { M } _ { \\epsilon _ { y } ^ { - 1 } } [ \\mathbf { P } _ { z } ^ { * } \\mathbf { h } _ { x } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } - k _ { x , m } \\mathbf { h } _ { z } ^ { n + 1 } - \\mathbf { j } _ { y } ^ { n + 0 . 5 } ] , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where \\~exnþ0.5;

The equations involving these operators can be solved easily by the “elimination” method [21]. In order to obtain second order convergence and avoid time step reduction, we use the conformal method with enlarged boundary cells in the same way as described for the rotationally symmetric case in [24]. However, for the stability of the conformal scheme it was crucial to use the full interpolation scheme with eight weights as described in [22].  \n IX. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES  \n In this section we consider two example calculations: a corrugated pipe (“dechirper”) with perfectly conducting walls, and a tapered collimator with resistive walls. We compare results obtained with ECHO(2D) with those of several 3D codes.  \n For our dechirper example we used the parameters of the dechirper experiment performed at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory [25]. The geometry is shown in Fig. 1(a). The dechirper structure is $1 \\mathrm { m }$ long, has a width $2 w = 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and is made of aluminum. The corrugations are characterized by the period $p = 0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , height $h = 0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and aspect ratio $h / t = 2$ . The gap between the jaws is adjustable; at a nominal setting the full gap $2 a = 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ .  \n We have performed calculations of the wakes for a Gaussian bunch with rms length $\\sigma _ { z } = 0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . The transverse dimensions of the bunch were assumed negligibly small. In the right plots of Figs. 7–8, we show some of the harmonics $W _ { m } ^ { c c } ( k _ { x } , s )$ and $k _ { x , m } ^ { 2 } W _ { m } ^ { s s } ( k _ { x } , s )$ , calculated for $2 w = 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ . If the bunch passes through the middle of the structure, at $x _ { 0 } = w$ , then only odd harmonics are excited. In the left plots of Figs. 7–8, these functions are shown as continuous functions of $k _ { x }$ (denoted with subscript $m$ removed); they are independent of the width parameter  \n $2 w$ . (Here we have used $2 w = 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ to obtain a denser sampling of the functions in the figures.) Finally, in Fig. 9, we compare the longitudinal (left plot) and the dipole (right plot) wakes obtained with ECHO(2D) with the existing, fully 3D code, ECHO(3D) [6]. In the calculation of the wake potentials, where the width $2 w = 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ , we used only the first 15 odd harmonics. We see that the agreement with the existing code is very good.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I. For the Pohang dechirper, for a Gaussian bunch with $\\sigma _ { z } = 0 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ : the ratio of the numerically obtained and the analytical result (see [25]), that we denote by $r .$ We compare the results given in Ref. [26], $r [ \\mathrm { T } 3 \\mathrm { P } ]$ , with the new results, $r [ \\mathrm { E C H O } ]$ .

The results in the table, denoted by $r _ { \\mathrm { { ; } } }$ , have been normalized to analytical results, valid for infinitesimally small corrugations (see [25]). We see good agreement except for the case of the dipole wake. (Note, however, that we have good reason to believe that $r$ should always be $\\leq 1 .$ ) Incidentally, it should be noted that in [25] the strength of the wakes of the Pohang dechirper were measured, both the longitudinal and transverse wakes, and it was estimated that their measured (effective) $r$ was about 0.75, a result that is in good accord with the ECHO(2D) results.  \n As the second example problem we consider a symmetric, tapered collimator [see Fig. 1(b)]. The dimensions are: width $2 w = 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ , height of large pipe $2 a = 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ , length of tapers $T = 5 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ ; height and length of the minimum gap section, $2 b = 2 { \\mathrm { ~ c m } }$ and $L = 1 2 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ . As was mentioned above, ECHO(2D) is capable of modeling structures with metallic walls of finite conductivity. The tapered walls and the walls of the minimum gap section are taken to have conductivity $\\sigma = 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { S / m } }$ [note, that condition (64) is well fulfilled], while the remaining surfaces are assumed to be perfectly conducting. In the left plot of Fig. 10 we compare the longitudinal wake for this collimator with one that has the same geometry but is perfectly conducting. The Gaussian bunch in the simulations has an rms length $\\sigma _ { z } = 0 . 2 5 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ . Both wakes were obtained with ECHO(2D). In the right plot of Fig. 10 we compare the ECHO (2D) wake potential with the one obtained using a fully three-dimensional, commercially available code CST [27]. The good agreement between the results indicates a good accuracy of the conformal meshing and the resistive wall modeling in ECHO(2D).  \n Finally, in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the new code to calculate wakes of very short bunches, we give in Fig. 11 the calculated loss factor $\\varkappa = \\langle W _ { \\| } ( 0 , 0 , s ) \\rangle$ as function of bunch length in the $1 \\mathrm { m }$ -long Pohang dechirper (black plotting symbols). Note that the shortest bunch length used in the calculations is $\\sigma _ { z } = 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The dimensions of the bunch and of the structure are different by 5 orders of magnitude. To our knowledge such kind of calculations cannot be done by any 3D code available. For the shorter bunches, the loss factor in a $1 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ -long structure is larger than the steady-state (periodic) result. We can see that by plotting on the same figure the difference of $x$ for a $2 \\mathrm { m }$ structure minus that for a $1 \\mathrm { m }$ structure (the gray curve). Note that the analytical, asymptotic value of the loss factor, for $\\sigma _ { z }  0$ , is $\\varkappa = Z _ { 0 } c L / ( 2 \\pi a ^ { 2 } ) \\cdot ( \\pi ^ { 2 } / 1 6 ) = 1 2 3 4 \\$ . $\\mathrm { v / p C }$ [we have taken $Z _ { 0 } = 3 7 7 \\Omega$ , structure length  \n $L = 1 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ , and half-gap $a = 3 \\mathrm { m m } ]$ , which agrees well with the linear extrapolation of the ECHO(2D) steady-state results (the gray curve).  \n X. SUMMARY  \n In this paper we presented a new method for solving electromagnetic problems and calculating wakefields excited by a relativistic bunch in a structure that is characterized by a rectangular cross-section whose height can vary as function of longitudinal coordinate but whose width and side walls remain fixed. Using the Fourier expansion of the fields, currents and charge densities, we derived a Fourier representation of the wake potential in terms of four onedimensional functions for each harmonic. We proved that the longitudinal wake is a harmonic function with respect of the coordinates of the leading charge. For a structure that has a horizontal symmetry plane we also proved an important symmetry relation of the wake function.  \n A numerical method was proposed for solving Fourier harmonics of the fields. The method does not generate dispersion in the longitudinal direction and for perfectly conducting geometry it conserves the energy and charge in the calculations. Additionally, we have described a new hybrid conformal scheme for structures with walls of finite conductivity. The computer resources required to find several tens of the lowest harmonics are moderate and comparable to those needed for 2D rotationally symmetric calculations.  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n The authors thank M.

It was proposed already in 1962 [2, 3], shortly after the invention of the laser. The use of dielectric gratings in conjunction with laser light sources has been named Dielectric Laser Acceleration (DLA) after it became a viable approach to accelerate electrons with record gradients. These record gradients are enabled especially by modern ultrashort-pulsed laser systems, mostly in the infrared spectrum, and by nanofabrication techniques for the high damage threshold dielectric materials, as adopted from the semiconductor industry. Due to these high technical demands, the experimental demonstration of electron acceleration in DLA came only in 2013, more than 50 years later than the original proposal [4, 5]. These promising results of gradients, generating only energy spread so far, lead to the funding of the ACHIP collaboration [6], in order to achieve an accelerator attaining MeV energy gain. A summary of DLA research as it stood in 2014 is given in [7].  \n Key to the high gradients in DLA is the synchronization of optical near fields to relativistic electrons, expressed by the Wideroe condition  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { g } = m \\beta \\lambda\n$$ \n where $\\lambda _ { g }$ is the grating period, $\\lambda$ is the laser wavelength, and $\\beta = \\nu / c$ is the the electron velocity in units of the speed of light. The integer number $m$ represents the spatial harmonic number at which the acceleration takes place. The zeroth harmonic is excluded by means of the Lawson-Woodward theorem [7] as it represents just a plane wave; the first harmonic $( m = 1 )$ is most suitable for acceleration, as it usually has the highest amplitude. Phase synchronous acceleration (fulfilling Eq. 1.1) at the first harmonic can be characterized by the synchronous Fourier coefficient  \n $$\ne _ { 1 } ( x , y ) = \\frac { 1 } { \\lambda _ { g } } \\int _ { \\lambda _ { g } } E _ { z } ( x , y , z ) e ^ { 2 \\pi i z / \\lambda _ { g } } \\mathrm { d } z\n$$ \n where $E _ { z }$ is the longitudinal component of the electric field at the laser center frequency in the channel. Often, $E _ { z }$ is normalized to the amplitude of the incident laser field. The transverse dependence of $\\boldsymbol { e } _ { 1 }$ allows also to calculate the the transverse kicks by means of the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [8, 9].  \n The laser systems used in current experiments are mostly $8 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ Ti:Sapphire amplifiers providing femtosecond pulses; either directly or followed by an Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) to transform into longer infrared wavelengths. Other systems based on $1 0 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ sources are also available. Moreover, with modern Holmium / Thulium doped fiber systems, $2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ pulses can also be obtained directly. Generally, there is a quest for longer wavelength, as this eases the nanophotonic structure fabrication precision requirement. Working with ultrashort pulses in the femotsecond realm is paramount in DLA, in order obtain high electric fields at low pulse energy. The pulse energy divided by the transverse size defines the fluence, and the acceleration structure material choice is predominantly made by the counteracting figures of merit of high damage threshold fluence and high refractive index, both at given laser wavelength.  \n Usually the laser pulses are impinging laterally on the structures, with the polarization in the direction of electron beam propagation. Short pulses thus allow interaction with the electron beam only over a short distance. This lack of length scalability can be overcome by pulse front tilt (PFT), which can be obtained from dispersive optical elements, such as diffraction gratings or prisms [10]. At ultrarelativistic energy, a 45 degree tilted laser pulse can thus interact arbitrary long with an electron, while the interaction with each DLA structure cell can be arbitrary short. The current record gradient of $8 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { M e V / m }$ [11] and record energy gain of $3 1 5 { \\mathrm { ~ k e V } }$ [12] in DLA could be obtained in this way. Generally, the pulse front tilt angle $\\alpha$ must fulfill  \n $$\n\\tan \\alpha = { \\frac { 1 } { \\beta } }\n$$ \n in order to remain synchronous with the electron [11, 13, 14]. This requires a curved pulse front shape, especially for electron acceleration at low energy, where the speed increment is nonnegligible. A general derivation of the pulse front shape required for a given acceleration ramp design is given in [15], where also pulse length minima are discussed when the curved shape is approximated by linear pieces.  \n Looking towards applications of dielectric laser acceleration, electron diffraction and the generation of light with particular properties are the most catching items, besides the omnipresent goal of creating a TeV collider for elementary particle physics. As such we will look into DLA-type laser driven undulators, which intrinsically are able to exploit the unique properties of DLAtype electron microbunch trains. Morever, the DLA undulators allow creating significatly shorter undulator periods than conventional magnetic undulators, thus reaching the same photon energy at lower electron energy. On the long run, this shall enable us to build table-top lightsources with unprecented parameters [16].  \n  \n This paper is organized along such a light source beamline and the current efforts undertaken towards achieving it. We start with the ultralow emittance electron sources, which make use of the available technology of electron microscopes, to provide a beam suitable for injection into low energy (sub-relativisitic) DLAs. Then, news from the alternating phase focusing (APF) beam dynamics scheme is presented, especially that the scheme can be implemented in 3D fashion to confine and accelerate the highly dynamical low energy electrons. We also show a higher energy design, as APF can be applied for DLA from the lowest to the highest energies, it only requires individual structures. At high energy, also spatial harmonic focusing can be applied. This scheme gains a lot of flexibility from variable shaping of the laser pulse with a spatial light modulator (SLM) and keeping the acceleration structure fixed and strictly periodic. However, due to the large amount of laser energy required in the non-synchronous harmonics, it is rather inefficient. Last in the chain, a DLA undulator can make use both of synchronous and asynchrounous fields. We outline the ongoing development of tilted DLA grating undulators [17–19] towards first experiments in RF-accelerator facilities which provide the required high brightness ultrashort electron bunches.  \n 2 Ultra-low Emittance Injector  \n The sub- $4 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ wide accelerator channel and field non-uniformity in dielectric laser accelerators place very strict emittance requirements on the electron injector. Typical acceptances in an APF DLA designed for a 2 micron drive laser require a ${ \\sim } 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ beam waist radius and 1 mrad beam divergence at $3 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ to prevent substantial beam loss during acceleration [20]. Generating such a 10 pm-rad beam essentially requires the use of a nanometer scale cathode, most commonly implemented via nanotips of various flavors. A variety of nanotip emitters have demonstrated sufficiently low emittance for DLA applications in a standalone configuration, but an additional challenge is to re-focus the beam coming off a tip into a beam that can be injected into a DLA without ruining the emittance. An additional challenge is that most DLA applications require maximum beam current, so generally injection systems cannot rely on filtering to achieve the required emittance. As such, an ultra-low emittance injector for a DLA requires an ultra-low emittance source and low aberration focusing elements to re-image the tip source into the DLA device at 10’s to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { ^ { \\circ } s }$ of $\\mathrm { k e V }$ energy. Typical RF photoinjectors and flat cathode electron sources cannot produce $< 1 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ emittance beams without heavy emittance filtering [21].  \n There have been two major approaches to producing injectors of sufficiently high brightness. The first approach uses a nanotip cold field or Schottky emitter in an electron microscope column that has been modified for laser access to the cathode [14, 21, 22]. One can then leverage the decades of development that have been put into transmission electron microscopes with aberration corrected lenses. Such systems are capable of producing beams down to $2 \\mathrm { n m }$ rms with 6 mrad divergence while preserving about $3 \\ \\%$ of the electrons produced at the cathode [23], which meets the ${ \\sim } 1 0$ pm-rad DLA injector requirement for one electron per pulse. Transmission electron microscopes are also available at beam energies up to $3 0 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ or $\\beta = 0 . 7 8$ , which would reduce the complexity of the sub-relativistic DLA stage compared to a $3 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ or $\\beta = 0 . 3 3$ injection energy. Moreover, at higher injection energy, the aperture can be chosen wider, which respectively eases the emittance requirement. Laser triggered cold-field emission style TEMs tend to require more frequent flashing of the tip to remove contaminants and have larger photoemission fluctuations than comparable laser triggered Schottky emitter TEMs [21, 23].  \n  \n A major disadvantage of using modified transmission electron microscopes as the injector for a DLA is their large size and cost. A typical $2 0 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ system will have roughly a 1 meter distance from the electron source to the DLA. Efforts have been made to produce a a more compact electron injector by using an electro-static immersion lens built into the electron source region to directly focus the beam coming off of a nanotip source [24]. This allows the nanotip emitter to be re-imaged into a DLA device in less than $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ distance at $9 6 ~ \\mathrm { k e V }$ beam energy as shown in Fig. 1 [25]. Due to the relatively high beam divergence off the tip feeding directly into the immersion lens, this arrangement is more prone to aberrations than a system with focusing elements outside the electron acceleration region. As such, a 0.4 mrad divergence beam out of an immersion lens source will typically be focusable to $4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ rms without emittance filtering, resulting in a normalized emittance of 100 pm-rad, increasing to 300 pm-rad at 30 electrons per shot, which is better than the unfiltered emittance from a CW laser triggered Schottky emitter TEM [21]. The immersion lens reduces the DC acceleration gradient at the tip, increasing the effects of space-charge compared to other source designs. The initial immersion lens experiments were also performed using five-photon photoemission from silicon nanotips to suppress background emission, which results in a larger space charge energy spread than necessary [26].  \n Moving forward, there are possibilities of increasing the acceleration gradients in DC biased electron sources through the use of novel electrode materials and preparation [25, 27] to 20 to 70 $\\mathbf { k V / m m }$ or greater gradients. These higher gradients, combined with the local field enhancement at a nanotip emitter to just short of the field emission threshold, will result in higher brightness and lower emittance beams to be focused by downstream optics. Triggering the cathode with laser pulses matched to its work function also helps minimize the beam energy spread and reduce chromatic aberrations [26]. Beam energy spread is determined by the net effects of space-charge and excess cathode trigger photon energy, and can range from $0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { e V }$ FWHM for low charge single-photon excitation to over 5 eV FWHM for 100 electrons per shot [21]. This excess energy spread increased the electron bunch duration from a minimum of 200 fs to over 1 ps FWHM at high charge in a TEM [21]. The majority of the space charge induced energy spread occurs within a few microns of the emitter, emphasizing the importance of having a maximum acceleration field at the emitter [28].  \n  \n 3 Alternating Phase Focusing DLA  \n 3.1 Principle and Nanophotonic Structures  \n The advantage of high gradient in DLA comes with the drawback of non-uniform driving optical nearfields across the beam channel. The electron beam, which usually fills the entire channel, is therefore defocused. The defocusing is resonant, i.e. happening in each cell, and so strong that it cannot be overcome by external quadrupole or solenoid magnets [29]. The nearfields themselves can however be arranged in a way that focusing is obtained in at least one spatial dimension. Introducing phase jumps allows to alternate this direction along the acceleration channel and gives rise to the Alternating Phase Focusing (APF) method [30]. The first proposal of APF for DLA included only a twodimensional scheme (longitudinal and horizontal) and the assumption that the vertical transverse direction can be made invariant. This assumption is hard to hold in practice, since it would require structure dimensions (i.e. pillar heights) that are larger than the laser spot. The laser spot size, however, needs to be large for a sufficiently flat Gaussian top. Moreover, if the vertical dimension is considered invariant, the beam has to be confined by a single external quadrupole magnet [30, 31], which requires perfect alignment with the sub-micron acceleration channel. While these challenges can be assessed with symmetric flat double-grating structures with extremely large aspect ratio (channel height / channel width), it is rather unfeasible with pillar structures where the aspect ratio is limited to about 10-20. For these reasons, the remaining vertical forces render the silicon pillar structures suitable only for limited interaction length.  \n Different types of DLA structures (single cells) are described in Fig. 2 for low energy (subrelativistic) and in Fig. 6 for high energy (relativistic). The usual materials are silicon or fused silica $( \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } )$ , which can be nanofabricated by established techniques from the semiconductor industry. The vertical confinement problem can be solved by using a two-material wafer with high refractive index contrast as shown in Fig. 2 (e). This gives rise to the threedimensional APF for DLA scheme [15] which finally makes DLA fully length scalable.  \n From Maxwell’s equations and the phase synchronicity condition Eq. 1.1 one can derive the synchronous longitudinal field as  \n $$\ne _ { 1 } ( x , y ) = e _ { 1 0 } \\cosh ( i k _ { x } x ) \\cosh ( i k _ { y } y ) ,\n$$ \n where $e _ { 1 0 }$ is usually referred to as the structure constant. It needs to be determined for each structure individually (by numerical techniques) and takes values between 0.05 and 1.2 in practical cases. The propagation constants fulfill the dispersion relation  \n $$\nk _ { x } ^ { 2 } + k _ { y } ^ { 2 } = - \\frac { \\omega ^ { 2 } } { \\beta ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } c ^ { 2 } } ,\n$$ \n where $\\omega = 2 \\pi c / \\lambda$ is the laser angular frequency and $\\beta , \\gamma$ are the relativistic velocity and mass factors. Note that the longitudinal field Eq. 3.1 suffices to describe the entire threedimensional kick on a particle in the DLA cell, since the transverse kick can be calculated by the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [9]. The horizontal propagation constant $k _ { y }$ is always purely imaginary, that is an inherent consequence of DLA being a nearfield acceleration scheme. The vertical propagation constant $k _ { x }$ can however be either purely imaginary or purely real. If $k _ { x }$ is purely imaginary (as $k _ { y }$ ), we call the focusing scheme ’in-phase’, since both transverse directions are simultaneously focused, while the longitudinal direction is defocused, and vice versa. Oppositely, if $k _ { x }$ is real valued, the vertical direction $\\mathbf { \\tau } ( \\mathbf { x } )$ focuses simultaneously with the longitudinal direction, exactly when the horizontal direction (y) is defocusing and vice versa; the scheme is thus called ’counter-phase’.  \n Technically, counter-phase structures are much easier to realize than in-phase structures, since in-phase structures require passing the electron beam through a vertical region of low refractive index, i.e. two high-refractive index layers above and below the electron beam would be required [15]. Particularly, counter-phase structures can be implemented on Silicon on Insulator (SOI) wafers, which are commercially available and their processing is standard in nanophotonics. Moreover, the pillars on SOI can be grounded to remove lost electrons by individual lateral traces, without deteriorating the structure bandwidth [15, 20].  \n The 3D APF on SOI structures are shown in Fig. 3, along with a plot of $e _ { 1 } ( x , y )$ , exhibiting the quadrupolar shape inherent to the counter-phase scheme. Furtheremore it can be seen that a field enhancement is created by the reflection from the oxide to substrate interface. A complete threedimensional accelerator design on a commercial SOI wafer, doubling the electron energy is shown in [20], alongside with a complete start to end simulation, first in DLAtrack6D [9] and then a full simulation in CST Particle Studio [32]. A major finding of this extensive simulation study was that the vertical phase gradient $\\partial _ { x }$ arg $e _ { 1 } ( x , y )$ needs to be controlled, as it exerts a constant vertical force similar to a homogeneous magnetic field that would drive the beam outside the channel. Controlling the phase gradient can be done by shaping the pillars or by adjusting the ground connection trace longitudinal position. Finally, the result is that a $1 0 \\mathrm { p m }$ transverse geometric emittance beam can be accelerated from $2 6 . 5 \\mathrm { k e V }$ to $5 3 \\mathrm { k e V }$ over a length of less than  \n $ { 0 . 4 \\mathrm { m m } }$ with a throughput of roughly $5 0 \\%$ .  \n As shown in Fig. 4, multiple acceleration stages can be arranged on a single SOI chip. Each stage roughly doubles the energy and is characterized by the laser pulse front tilt angle, corresponding to an ’average’ beam velocity in the stage (See [15] Supplementary material for the optimal constant tilt angle within a stage). Between the stages, a vertical adjustment of the beam position can be done by electrostatic steerers, which use the substrate and another silicon on glass wafer, attached from the top as two plates of a deflecting capacitor. The contacting can be done on the device layer of the SOI wafer. Due to the small distance of the plates, voltages of only about 30V are sufficient to obtain sufficiently large deflections to counteract accumulated deflection errors over hundreds of periods.  \n 3.2 Low Energy Applications and Experiments  \n At low energy, acceleration gradients are not that critical, since an accelerator chip will only be of the size of a thumbnail to reach relativistic velocity, which we define as $1 \\ \\mathrm { M e V }$ electron energy. Therefore, gradient can be sacrificed to some extend for flexibility and improved beam confinement. The first sacrifice is the utilization of materials which are DC-conductive and have a high refractive index, but suffer a significantly lower laser damage threshold. The best example of such is silicon, which also allows us to use the wide range of semiconductor fabrication tools.  \n By etching the pillars by electron beam lithography and the ’mesa’ by photo lithography, several low energy electron manipulation devices, well known in the accelerator toolbox, were created on a chip. These are ballistic bunchers [33, 34], APF single cells and channels [35, 36], and the first demonstration of low energy spread bunching and coherent acceleration in DLA [37]. Yet all these devices suffer from lack of real length scalability due to a 2D design with insufficient pillar height. Moreover, the coherent acceleration experiment did not attain the energy spread as low as predicted by 2D simulations. The reason for this is the fluctuation of the structure constant $\\boldsymbol { e } _ { 1 }$ as function of the vertical coordinate in conjunction with the beam being unconfined vertically. By building a 3D APF multistage buncher, energy spreads as low as predicted in the 2D simulations have been demonstrated in full 3D simulations, and should thus be achieved in experiments soon. A design and full 3D field and particle simulation of such a multi-stage 3D APF buncher and accelerator is shown in Fig. 5  \n 3.3 High Energy High Gradient Acceleration  \n In order to exploit the unique features of DLA for a high energy accelerator, a high damage threshold material has to be used. A list of such materials is provided in [38]. A particular material which was used to obtain the record gradients the experiments is Fused Silica $( \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 } )$ [4, 11, 39]. By bonding two $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ gratings together a symmetric structure is obtained, however, in order to obtain the symmetric fields in the channel also the laser illumination must be symmetric. Theoretically, a Bragg mirror could also be used here, however its fabrication using layers of $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ and vacuum is technically challenging. Moreover, the bonded grating structures are essentially 2D, i.e. the laser spot is smaller than the large aperture dimension. This leads to the small focusing strength as discussed above as $k _ { x } = 0$ and $k _ { y } = i \\omega / ( \\beta \\gamma c ) \\to 0$ for $\\beta \\to 1$ . Strong improvement comes from applying 3D APF in the counter-phase scheme. Structures for this are depicted in Fig. 6. Note that for highly relativistic velocities the in-phase scheme is practically impossible as Eq. 3.1 implies that in this case $e _ { 1 } ( x , y )$ should be constant, and matching with the boundary conditions implies that it must be close to zero. We show an example of casting the counter-phase structures in Fig. 6 (c) and (d) into an accelerator gaining $1 \\mathrm { M e V }$ at $4 \\mathrm { M e V }$ injection energy. The design relies on etching a trench into a $\\mathrm { S i O } _ { 2 }$ slab and leaving out a pillar row with APF phase jumps, see Fig. 7. By direct bonding of two such slabs, 3D APF structures of a single material, as shown in Fig. 6 (c) and (d), are obtained. At a synchronous phase 30 degrees off crest and $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { M V / m }$ incident laser field from both sides, about 3000 periods ( $\\mathrm { \\Delta } 6 \\mathrm { m m }$ total length) are required to obtain $1 \\mathrm { M e V }$ energy gain. Figure 7 shows the structure, the electric field, and the betafunctions of a designed lattice containing 7 focusing periods. This structure, or respectively lattice, is not yet optimized. The parameters, including the $8 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ aperture, were chosen rather arbitrarily. A preliminary DLAtrack6D simulation shows that an energy gain of $1 \\mathrm { M e V }$ with a throughput of about $70 \\%$ can be obtained with about $0 . 0 8 { \\mathrm { n m } }$ rad normalized emittance and 0.08 fs FWHM bunchlength.  \n  \n  \n 4 Spatial Harmonic Focusing  \n One important assumption in the APF discussion is that particles mainly interact with the resonant electromagnetic waves as they propagate in the DLA structure. That is the effect of waves propagating with phase velocity different than the velocity of the electrons averages out and does not play a significant role in the dynamics [9]. For relativistic DLAs where the velocity of the particles and of the waves inside the structure are all close to the speed of light (and their differences tends to zero), this approximation needs to be carefully reviewed. If the difference in phase velocity is not very large, in fact, even the non resonant harmonics in the field (which can be always modeled as a sum of spatial harmonics) will contribute to the dynamics.  \n An interesting alternative scheme for focusing has been proposed by Naranjo et al. [40] and borrows from the concept of second order focusing in conventional RF structures [41]. In that paper the authors considered a structure with a super-period length $\\lambda _ { S } = 2 \\pi / \\delta _ { k }$ added to the accelerating wave. Then, using Floquet’s theorem, the field can be decomposed into spatial harmonics. Due to the different phase velocities of these harmonics, only one of these can be resonant (i.e. maintain a nearly constant phase) with the electrons, while all the other ones will wash out over the beam as it propagates in the DLA. The alternation of focusing and defocusing phases would have a net focusing effect which can be used to counteract the resonant defocusing force and maintain the beam confined in the accelerating channel.  \n 4.1 Ponderomotive focusing  \n To simplify and generalize the discussion one can imagine the electrons to be moving in the field of two waves of electric field amplitude $E _ { 0 }$ and $E _ { 1 }$ respectively, one with velocity $\\beta _ { r }$ phase synchronous with the beam (which provides stable longitudinal acceleration, but with a net defocusing effect) and the other one at a slower velocity $\\beta _ { 1 } \\cong \\beta _ { r } - \\delta _ { k } / k$ where $k = 2 \\pi / \\lambda _ { g }$ is the wavenumber of the DLA structure. In a 2D perfect slab-geometry, we can neglect the motion in the long structure dimension and close to the axis the equations of motion for the electron deviation from the resonant energy $\\delta \\gamma$ and for its normalized transverse velocity $y ^ { \\prime }$ can be written as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } & { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial \\delta \\gamma } { \\partial z } = - \\frac { q E _ { 0 } } { m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } } \\sin \\phi - \\frac { q E _ { 1 } } { m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } } \\sin \\left( \\phi + \\delta _ { k } z \\right) } & \\\\ & { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\partial y ^ { \\prime } } { \\partial z } = \\frac { q E _ { 0 } } { m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } } \\frac { k y } { \\gamma ^ { 3 } \\beta ^ { 2 } } \\cos \\phi + \\frac { q E _ { 1 } } { m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } } \\frac { k y } { \\gamma \\beta } ( 1 - \\beta \\beta _ { 1 } ) \\cos \\left( \\phi + \\delta _ { k } z \\right) , } & \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } / q = 5 1 1 \\mathrm { \\ k V }$ is the rest energy equivalent and $\\phi$ is the phase within one DLA cell. Analyzing the solutions of the equation for transverse motion into a slowly varying secular component and a fast oscillation, we can rewrite for the slow drift motion  \n $$\n{ \\frac { \\partial y ^ { \\prime } } { \\partial z } } = { \\frac { q E _ { 0 } } { m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } } } { \\frac { k y } { \\gamma ^ { 3 } \\beta ^ { 2 } } } \\cos \\phi - \\left[ { \\frac { E _ { 1 } } { m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } } } { \\frac { k } { \\gamma \\beta } } ( 1 - \\beta \\beta _ { 1 } ) \\right] ^ { 2 } { \\frac { y } { 2 \\delta _ { k } ^ { 2 } } }\n$$ \n and noting that the coefficient second term is negative for all phases, retrieve the ponderomotive focusing effect [42]. The main drawback of the ponderomotive focusing scheme (compared to the APF scheme discussed above) is the significant need for power in the non-resonant harmonic $E _ { 1 }$ to compensate the strong resonant defocusing, so that the laser is not efficiently used to accelerate the particles (i.e. $E _ { 0 }$ is relatively small). Interestingly, in 2D APF focusing schemes the focusing term scales with the energy as $1 / \\gamma ^ { 3 }$ , here it scales as $1 / \\gamma ^ { 2 }$ and for the 3D APF scheme it scales as $1 / \\gamma$ [15], which eventually dominates over the resonant defocusing scaling as $1 / \\gamma ^ { 3 }$ . Thus, spatial harmonic focusing provides a matched (average) beta function proportional to the beam energy, perfectly compensating the adiabatic geometric emittance decrease to provide a constant spot size along the accelerator.  \n 4.2 Soft tuning of DLA parameters  \n The original plan proposed to hard-wire spatial harmonics into the structure to obtain the ponderomotive focusing effect. In practice, one can also simply modulate the drive laser phase, effectively introducing spatial harmonics into a generic, strictly periodic grating, see Fig. 8. This is due to the low Q-factor of the structures used for DLA, so that the fields in the electron beam channel are actually faithful reproductions of the illuminating laser pulses. Therefore, dynamically controlling phase and amplitude of the drive laser actually offers an interesting alternative to soften the tight tolerance requirements on structure fabrication and enable tuning of the accelerator characteristics without the need to modify/manufacture delicate and expensive dielectric structures [43].  \n While it is likely that in the future phase and amplitude control of the drive pulses will be implemented using on-chip laser manipulation [44, 45], the first exploratory research can be carried out using free space coupling combining pulse front tilt illumination with modern technologies readily available for nearly arbitrary shaping of laser fields in the transverse plane.  \n Pulse front tilt can be easily coupled with standard methods for spatial light manipulation such as digital micromirror devices or liquid crystal masks [46]. Exploiting the 2D nature of these devices, they can be used to apply not only arbitrary phase, but also arbitrary amplitude masks to the transverse profile of the laser which gets converted by the pulse front tilt illumination into temporal modulation seen by the electrons. As masks can be changed essentially online, at very high repetition rates (up to KHz), such system will allow to fine tune the DLA output beam parameters online, with direct guidance from beam diagnostics. In the experimental phase this will also allow testing of various beam dynamics control approaches, including alternate phase focusing, ponderomotive focusing or anything else in between. A new code has been developed to self-consistently calculate the interaction of relativistic particles with different phase velocities spatial harmonics [47] (see Fig. 9).  \n  \n In fact, with a full control over amplitude and phase seen by the particles the question becomes how to best optimize the drive pulse. At this purpose, it is envisioned adopting machine learning algorithms to optimize the 2D mask which gets applied to the laser drive pulse by the liquid crystal modulator [48].  \n 5 DLA Undulator  \n Similar to a conventional magnetic undulator, a DLA undulator needs to provide an oscillatory deflection force as well as transversal confinement to achieve stable beam transport and scalable radiation emission. On the long run, a DLA based radiation source would use beams provided by a DLA accelerator. However, closer perspectives to experiments favor using advanced RF accelerators which can also provide single digit femtosecond bunches at high brightness. The ARES accelerator [49] at SINBAD/DESY provides such beam parameters suitable to be injected into DLA undulators. Thus, we adapt our design study on the $1 0 7 \\mathrm { M e V }$ electron beam of ARES.  \n 5.1 Tilted Grating Design  \n Figure 10 shows one cell of a tilted DLA structure composed of two opposing silica $\\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { r } } = 2 . 0 6 8 1 \\$ ) diffraction gratings for the laser wavelength $\\lambda = 2 \\pi / k = 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The laser excites a grating-periodic electromagnetic field with $k _ { \\mathrm { z } } = 2 \\pi / \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ which imposes a deflection force [17] on the electrons. Our investigation considers two different concepts for the application of tilted DLA gratings as undulators. First, the concept introduced in refs. [17, 18] which uses a phase-synchronous DLA structure fulfilling the Wideroe condition Eq. (1.1) (see ref. [9] for an analysis of the dynamics therein). Second, a concept similar to microwave [50], terahertz [51] or laser [52] driven undulators which uses a non-synchronous DLA structure that does not fulfill Eq. (1.1).  \n Efficient operation of the DLA undulator requires a design with optimized cell geometry to maximize the interaction of the electron beam with the laser field. Figure 11 shows simulation results for a parameter scan of the tilt angle $\\alpha$ and the fill factor $r _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ which is the tooth width divided by the grating period. The tooth height is kept constant at $h = 1 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The Fourier coefficient $\\boldsymbol { e } _ { 1 }$ at the aperture center indicated by the red line as defined in Eq. (1.2) is a figure of merit for the interaction strength. For a DLA structure with reasonable aperture $\\Delta y = 1 . 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and tilt angle $\\alpha \\approx 2 5$ degrees the available structure constant is $\\left| e _ { 1 } \\right| / E _ { 0 } \\approx 0 . 4$ . At $2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , a reasonably short (three digit fs) laser pulse provides at the damage threshold of silica a maximum field strength of $E _ { 0 } \\approx 1 \\ldots 2 \\mathrm { G V / m }$ .  \n 5.2 Analytical Model for the Non-Synchronous Undulator  \n The investigation of the non-synchronous DLA undulator concept allows to use an analytical model similar to Ref. [53]. The Hamiltonian for electrons with charge $q$ , mass $m _ { 0 }$ , momentum components $p _ { i } = \\gamma \\beta _ { i } , i = \\{ x , y , z \\}$ in a electromagnetic vector potential a $( x , y , z , c t )$ defined with dimensionless quantities is  \n $$\nH \\left( x , p _ { \\mathrm { x } } , y , p _ { \\mathrm { y } } , c t , \\gamma ; z \\right) = - \\sqrt { \\gamma ^ { 2 } - 1 - { \\left( p _ { \\mathrm { x } } - a _ { \\mathrm { x } } \\right) } ^ { 2 } - { \\left( p _ { \\mathrm { y } } - a _ { \\mathrm { y } } \\right) } ^ { 2 } } - a _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\ .\n$$ \n Note that since the independent parameter is $z$ , the Hamiltonian represents the longitudinal momentum $p _ { z }$ and not the total energy. The electromagnetic field along the electron beam path of a tilted DLA structure can be written as a periodic vector potential in the form of  \n $$\n\\mathbf { a } \\left( x , y , z , c t \\right) = a _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\cosh \\left( k _ { \\mathrm { y } } y \\right) \\sin \\left( k c t - k _ { \\mathrm { z } } z + k _ { \\mathrm { x } } x \\right) \\mathbf { e } _ { \\mathrm { z } }\n$$ \n with the reciprocal grating vectors of the tilted DLA cell $k _ { \\mathrm { z } }$ and $k _ { \\mathrm { x } } ~ = ~ k _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\tan \\alpha$ (see ref. [9]), ${ k _ { \\mathrm { y } } } \\equiv \\sqrt { \\left| { k ^ { 2 } - { k _ { \\mathrm { x } } } ^ { 2 } - { k _ { \\mathrm { z } } } ^ { 2 } } \\right| } ,$ , and the dimensionless amplitude defined as  \n $$\n{ a } _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\equiv \\frac { q \\left| \\boldsymbol { e } _ { 1 } \\left( \\alpha \\right) \\right| / k } { m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } } \\mathrm { ~ . ~ }\n$$ \n In general, Eq. (5.1) and Hamilton’s equations yield six coupled nonlinear differential equations for the phase space coordinates $x , p _ { \\mathrm { x } } , y , p _ { \\mathrm { y } } , c t$ , and $\\gamma$ as a function of the independent variable 𝑧. For a DLA undulator with $E _ { 0 } \\sim 1 \\mathrm { G e V } / \\mathrm { m }$ electric field strength, the rest mass of an electron is much larger than its energy modulation across one laser wavelength. Consequently, the amplitude of the dimensionless vector potential, $a _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\approx 6 . 2 e - 4 \\ll 1$ , is small and allows to calculate the solutions of Eq. (5.1) by perturbation. Taking into account the second order terms ${ \\cal O } \\left( \\gamma _ { 0 } \\mathrm { } ^ { - 2 } \\right)$ and the first order terms $O \\left( a _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\right)$ for the $1 0 7 \\mathrm { M e V }$ beam yields analytic approximations for the energy $\\gamma \\left( z \\right)$ and the transverse position $x \\left( z \\right)$ of the electron. Figure 12 compares the approximations with numerically computed solutions of Eq. (5.1). In contrast to a magnetostatic undulator the energy in a DLA undulator oscillates, as can be seen in Fig. 12 a). The analytical approximation for $x \\left( z \\right)$ yields an adequate estimate for the amplitude and periodicity of the transversal particle oscillation in Fig. 12 b). Adding the $O \\left( a _ { \\mathrm { z } } ^ { 2 } \\right)$ terms also reproduces the drift motion, sufficient to provide a good agreement with the numerical solution. A synchronicity deviation as compared to Eq. (1.1) leads to a drift of the drive laser phase with respect to the electron beam. Accordingly, the deflection in $x$ -direction alternates its sign, although the tilt angle remains constant [54]. Thus, the wave number ${ k _ { \\mathrm { u } } } = 2 \\pi / { \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } } }$ of the DLA undulator can be determined as  \n  \n $$\nk _ { \\mathrm { u } } \\approx \\frac { 1 } { \\beta } k - k _ { \\mathrm { z } } .\n$$ \n The analytical model provides design guidelines for the experimental realization of an DLA undulator. In Eq. (5.4) the deviation of $k$ with respect to a synchronous DLA structure determines the undulator wavelength $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } }$ . Hence, altering the laser frequency allows direct adjustments of $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } }$ . Aside from the oscillatory deflection the longitudinal field $a _ { \\mathrm { z } }$ induces a transversal drift motion which depends on the relative phase  \n $$\n\\varphi _ { \\mathrm { 0 } } \\equiv k c t _ { \\mathrm { 0 } } + k _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\tan \\alpha x _ { \\mathrm { 0 } } \\ .\n$$ \n In exactly the same way as for a magnetostatic undulator this effect might be mitigated by smoothly tapering the deflection field amplitude towards both undulator ends. For an electron in the center of the beam channel the undulator parameter [55] in the analytical model is  \n $$\nK _ { \\mathrm { z } } = a _ { \\mathrm { z } } { \\frac { k _ { \\mathrm { x } } } { k _ { \\mathrm { u } } } } = { \\frac { q } { m _ { 0 } c ^ { 2 } } } { \\frac { k _ { \\mathrm { z } } } { k k _ { \\mathrm { u } } } } \\left| e _ { 1 } \\left( \\alpha \\right) \\right| \\tan \\alpha \\ .\n$$ \n Figure $1 3 \\mathrm { a }$ ) shows the dependency of the undulator parameter $K _ { \\mathrm { z } }$ on the grating tilt angle $\\alpha$ and the undulator wavelength $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } }$ in a vertically symmetric opposing silica grating structure. For this purpose the synchronous harmonic $\\boldsymbol { e } _ { 1 }$ at the center of the structure was determined as function of the tilt angle. The undulator parameter $K _ { \\mathrm { z } }$ shows a local maximum at an tilt angle of $\\alpha \\approx 2 5$ degrees. Furthermore, $K _ { \\mathrm { z } }$ increases linearly with the undulator wavelength $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } }$ . We investigate a design using $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } } = 4 0 0 \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { z } }$ which corresponds to an effective undulator parameter of $K _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\approx 0 . 0 4 5$ . In Fig. 13 b) the detuning with respect to the synchronous operation $k - \\beta k _ { \\mathrm { z } }$ determines the transversal oscillation amplitude $\\hat { x }$ and the energy of the generated photons $E _ { \\mathrm { p } }$ . For $0 . 2 5 \\%$ deviation from synchronicity, the silica DLA undulator induces a $\\hat { x } \\approx 3 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ electron beam oscillation and a wavelength of [55]  \n  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { { p } } } = \\frac { \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { { u } } } } { 2 { \\gamma _ { 0 } } ^ { 2 } } \\left( 1 + \\frac { { K _ { \\mathrm { { z } } } } ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \\right) \\approx 9 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } , }\n$$ \n corresponding to soft $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { X } }$ -rays with $E _ { \\mathrm { p } } = 0 . 1 4 ~ \\mathrm { k e V } .$ .  \n 5.3 Simulation of the Beam Dynamics in Tilted Gratings  \n Using the particle tracking code DLATrack6D [9] we investigate the beam dynamics in both a synchronous as well as a non-synchronous DLA undulator. Each undulator wavelength $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } } = 8 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ of the investigated structure consists of 400 tilted DLA cells which are joined along the $z$ -direction. The total length of the undulator is $1 6 . 4 \\mathrm { m m }$ which corresponds to 8200 DLA cells with $\\lambda _ { g } = 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ or $\\approx 2 0$ undulator periods. In order to alternate the deflection for an oscillatory electron motion the relative laser phase needs to shift by $2 \\pi$ in total as the beam passes one undulator wavelength. For that reason, the synchronous DLA undulator design introduces a $\\pi$ phase shift after each $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } } / 2$ . In an experimental setup this can be achieved either by drift sections such as used in the APF scheme or by laser pulse shaping e.g. by a liquid crystal phase mask. In the non-synchronous undulator the drift of the drive laser phase with respect to the electron beam automatically introduces the required shift to modulate the deflection force. Hence, subsequent grating cells automatically induce an oscillatory electron motion.  \n Synchronous DLA undulators have already been simulated with DLAtrack6D, see [9]. If the phase drift per DLA cell is small $( \\Delta \\varphi = k _ { \\mathrm { u } } \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { z } } \\ll 1 )$ , DLAtrack6D can also be applied to nonsynchronous structures. Considering for instance the y-momentum kick, linearization of Eq. (5.1)  \n including terms up to $O \\left( \\Delta \\varphi ^ { 2 } \\right)$ yields  \n $$\n\\Delta y ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { \\Delta p _ { \\mathrm { y } } } { \\gamma _ { 0 } \\beta _ { 0 } } = - k _ { \\mathrm { y } } \\lambda \\frac { a _ { 0 } } { \\gamma _ { 0 } } \\frac { \\left| e _ { \\mathrm { l } } \\left( \\alpha \\right) \\right| } { E _ { 0 } } \\sinh { \\left( k _ { \\mathrm { y } } y _ { 0 } \\right) } \\sin \\varphi _ { 0 } + O \\left( \\beta _ { \\mathrm { x } } \\right) + O \\left( \\beta _ { \\mathrm { y } } \\right) + O \\left( \\frac { k _ { \\mathrm { u } } } { k _ { \\mathrm { z } } } \\right) .\n$$ \n The first term recovers the tracking equation of DLATrack6D (see ref. [9]). The correction terms contribute less than $1 \\%$ for the investigated structures.  \n Figure 14 a) compares tracking results for the particle at the beam center of a synchronous and a non-synchronous DLA undulator. In the synchronous undulator the phase jumps by $\\Delta \\varphi _ { 0 } = \\pi$ due to a $\\lambda _ { g } / 2$ drift section after each ${ \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } } } / { 2 }$ such that deflection force acting on the particle always switches between its maximum and minimum value. Hence, the reference particle’s momentum $x ^ { \\prime }$ changes linearly between two segments. The subsequent triangular trajectory introduces contributions of higher harmonics into the radiation. Furthermore, the accumulation of deflections leads to a deviation from the reference trajectory for $z \\ge 1 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ and the accumulated extra distance travelled by the reference particle leads to dephasing, which damps the momentum oscillation. In the non-synchronous DLA undulator the particle trajectory follows a harmonic motion. A smooth phase shift of $\\Delta \\varphi _ { \\mathrm { 0 } } = 2 \\pi \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { z } } / \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } }$ per DLA cell generates a harmonically oscillating deflection which is approximately $30 \\%$ smaller compared to the synchronous DLA. A tapering of the deflection strength introduced towards $z = 0$ and $z = 1 6 . 4 \\mathrm { m m }$ ensures a smooth transition at the ends of the non-synchronous DLA undulator.  \n Figure $1 4 \\mathrm { b }$ ) shows the width $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { y } }$ for an electron beam passing the DLA undulator without particle losses. A transversal geometric emittance of $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { y } } = 1 0 \\mathrm { p m }$ ensures $1 0 0 \\%$ transmission. The simulations use an electron beam with the twiss parameters $\\hat { \\alpha } = 0$ and $\\gamma = 1 / \\hat { \\beta }$ at $z = 0$ . Depending on the phase $\\varphi _ { 0 }$ the transversal momentum kick (5.8) in a DLA cell can be either focusing or defocusing in y-direction. Hence, the beam width oscillates but remains bounded for both DLA undulators. In order to achieve proper beam matching into the structure a future design study will address the focusing properties of both DLA undulator concepts in more detail.  \n Figure 15 shows the phase space of an electron beam passing a DLA undulator in a) nonsynchronous and b) synchronous operation mode. The transversal geometric emittance $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { x } } = 1 \\mathrm { n m }$ and the energy spread $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { E } } = 0 . 0 2 \\%$ follow the design parameters of ARES [56]. The bunch length is $\\sigma _ { t } = 1$ fs. The phase space in the center of the undulator at $z \\approx 9 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ shows that both DLA designs induce transversal electron oscillations across the whole beam. However, the transverse electron beam size is larger than one unit cell of the DLA undulator such that the particle distribution transversely ranges across several grating periods. For this reason the momentum $x ^ { \\prime }$ at $z \\approx 9 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ varies depending on the relative phase $\\varphi _ { 0 }$ in Eq. (5.5) of the electron with respect to the laser field. The averaged momentum of the particle beam remains zero. In the non-synchronous operation mode the particles experience an averaged deflection and focusing force. Thus, all electron trajectories are similar, but differ by a constant drift motion along the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -coordinate. The drift depends on the initial phase $\\varphi _ { 0 }$ at which the particle enters the undulator. In the synchronous mode each particle experiences a different deflection and focusing force which accumulates additive along one undulator period $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { u } }$ . The oscillation of each particle depends on its phase $\\varphi _ { 0 }$ . Thus, a substructure in the phase space slightly visible at $z \\approx 9 \\mathrm { { m m } }$ and more prominent towards the exit at $z \\approx 1 6 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { m m }$ develops as the beam passes the undulator.  \n 6 Conclusion  \n For the study of beam dynamics in DLA, computer simulations will remain essential. With combined numerical and experimental approaches, the challenges of higher initial brightness and brightness preservation along the beamline can be tackled.  \n  \n The electron sources available from electron microscopy technology are feasible for experiments, however cost and size puts a major constraint on them. The upcoming immersion lens nanotip sources offer a suitable alternative. Their performance does not reach the one of the commercial microscopes yet, but one can expect significant improvements in the near future. This will enable low energy DLA experiments with high energy gain and full six-dimensional confinement soon.  \n Full confinement is a requirement for high energy gain at low injection energies, since the low energy electrons are highly dynamical. Recent APF DLA experiments showed that (as theoretically expected) the so-called invariant dimension is in fact not invariant for the mostly used silicon pillar structures. The consequences are energy spread and emittance increase, eventually leading to beam losses. A way to overcome this is to turn towards a 3D APF scheme, which can be implemented on commercial SOI wafers. The 3D scheme has also advantages at high energy, since it avoids the focusing constants going to zero in the ultrarelativistic limit. Only the square-sum goes to zero and thus a counterphase scheme is possible with high individual focusing constants. Using a single high damage threshold material for these structures leads however to fabrication challenges.  \n The spatial harmonic focusing scheme is much less efficient than APF, since most of the damage threshold limited laser power goes into focusing rather than into acceleration gradient. However, when equipped with a focusing scheme imprinted on the laser pulse by a liquid crystal phase mask, it can operate on a generic, strictly periodic grating structure. This provides significantly improved experimental flexibility. Moreover, as the scheme intrinsically operates with different phase velocities of electromagnetic waves in the beam channel, it can be easily adapted to travelling wave structures.  \n For a high energy collider, travelling wave structures are definitely required to meet the laser energy efficiency requirement. They can efficiently transfer energy from a co-propagating laser pulse to the electrons, until the laser pulse is depleted. Laterally driven standing wave structures cannot deplete the pulse. In the best case, on can recycle the pulse in an integrated laser cavity [57]. However, significant improvement in energy efficiency as compared to the status quo can be obtained by waveguide driven DLAs, see [44, 45]. More information about the requirements and the feasibility of DLA for a high energy collider can be found in [58].  \n The on-chip light source is still under theoretical development. Currently we outline a computationally optimized silica grating geometry as well as an analytical description and numerical simulations of the dynamics for electrons passing a soft X-ray radiation DLA undulator. The analytical model provides essential guidelines for the ongoing design process. The concept of a non-synchronous tilted grating structure turns out to be a promising alternative to the synchronous operation mode. The non-synchronous undulator operates without phase jumps in the structure, which relaxes the fabrication requirements and the requirements on the drive laser phase front flatness. Furthermore, variation of the laser wavelength allows direct fine tuning of the undulator period length. Preliminary results indicate that in order to achieve approximately $5 0 \\%$ beam transmission, the geometric emittance must not exceed $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { y } } = 1 0 0 \\mathrm { p m }$ (at $1 0 7 \\mathrm { M e V } .$ ). Optimization of the beam focusing within the DLA undulator structures is outlined for investigations in the near future.  \n "

However, the amount of radiation that can ultimately be extracted from free electrons near an arbitrary material structure has remained elusive. Here we derive a fundamental upper limit to the spontaneous photon emission and energy loss of free electrons, regardless of geometry, which illuminates the effects of material properties and electron velocities. We obtain experimental evidence for our theory with quantitative measurements of Smith–Purcell radiation. Our framework allows us to make two predictions. One is a new regime of radiation operation—at subwavelength separations, slower (non-relativistic) electrons can achieve stronger radiation than fast (relativistic) electrons. The other is a divergence of the emission probability in the limit of lossless materials. We further reveal that such divergences can be approached by coupling free electrons to photonic bound states in the continuum11–13. Our findings suggest that compact and efficient free-electron radiation sources from microwaves to the soft X-ray regime may be achievable without requiring ultrahigh accelerating voltages.  \n The Smith–Purcell effect epitomizes the potential of free-electron radiation. Consider an electron at velocity $\\beta = \\nu / c$ traversing a structure with periodicity $a$ ; it generates far-field radiation at wavelength $\\lambda$ and polar angle $\\theta$ , dictated by2  \n $$\n\\lambda = \\frac { a } { m } \\left( \\frac { 1 } { \\beta } - \\mathrm { c o s } \\theta \\right)\n$$ \n where $m$ is the integer diffraction order. The absence of a minimum velocity in equation (1) offers prospects for threshold-free and spectrally tunable light sources, spanning from microwave and terahertz14–16, across visible17–19, and towards $\\bar { \\mathrm { X - r a y } } ^ { 2 0 }$ frequencies. In stark contrast to the simple momentum-conservation determination of wavelength and angle, there is no unified yet simple analytical equation for the radiation intensity. Previous theories offer explicit solutions only under strong assumptions (for example, assuming perfect conductors or employing effective medium descriptions) or for simple, symmetric geometries21–23. Consequently, heavily numerical strategies are often an unavoidable resort24,25. In general, the inherent complexity of the interactions between electrons and photonic media have prevented a more general understanding of how pronounced spontaneous electron radiation can ultimately be for arbitrary structures, and consequently, how to design the maximum enhancement for free-electron light-emitting devices.  \n  \n We begin our analysis by considering an electron (charge $- e$ ) of constant velocity $\\nu \\hat { \\mathbf { x } }$ traversing a generic scatterer (plasmonic or dielectric, finite or extended) of arbitrary size and material composition, as in Fig. 1a.

Hence, the photon emission and energy loss of free electrons can be treated as a scattering problem: the electromagnetic fields $\\mathbf { F } _ { \\mathrm { i n c } } { = } ( \\mathbf { E } _ { \\mathrm { i n c } } , \\ Z _ { 0 } \\mathbf { H } _ { \\mathrm { i n c } } ) ^ { \\mathrm { T } }$ (for free-space impedance $Z _ { 0 } ^ { \\mathrm { ~ \\tiny ~ { ~ \\chi ~ } ~ } }$ are incident on a photonic medium with material susceptibility $\\overline { { \\overline { { \\chi } } } }$ (a $6 { \\times } 6$ tensor for a general medium), causing both absorption and far-field scattering—that is, photon emission—that together comprise electron energy loss (Fig. 1a).  \n As recently shown in refs 27–29, for a generic electromagnetic scattering problem, passivity—the condition that polarization currents do no net work—constrains the maximum optical response from a given incident field. Consider three power quantities derived from $\\mathbf { F } _ { \\mathrm { i n c } }$ and the total field F within the scatterer volume $V !$ the total power lost by the electron, $P _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } } = - ( 1 / 2 ) \\mathrm { R e } \\int _ { \\mathrm { V } } \\mathbf { J } ^ { * } \\cdot \\mathbf { E d } V = ( \\epsilon _ { 0 } \\omega / 2 ) \\mathrm { I m } \\hat { \\int _ { V } } \\mathbf { F } _ { \\mathrm { ~ i n c } } ^ { \\dagger } \\overline { { \\chi } } \\mathbf { F d } V ,$ the power absorbed by the medium, $P _ { \\mathrm { { a b s } } } \\mathrm { { = } } \\left( \\epsilon _ { 0 } \\omega / 2 \\right) \\mathrm { I m } \\stackrel { \\cdot } { \\int } _ { V } \\mathbf { F } ^ { \\dagger } \\overline { { \\chi } } \\mathbf { F } \\mathrm { { d } } V ,$ and their difference, the power radiated to the far field, $P _ { \\mathrm { r a d } } { = } P _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } } { - } P _ { \\mathrm { a b s } }$ . Treating $\\mathbf { F }$ as an independent variable, the total loss $P _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } }$ is a linear function of $\\mathbf { F }$ , whereas the fraction that is dissipated is a quadratic function of F. Passivity requires non-negative radiated power, represented by the inequality $P _ { \\mathrm { a b s } } { < } P _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } } ,$ which in this framework is therefore a convex constraint on any response function. Constrained maximization (see Supplementary Section 1) of the energy-loss and photon-emission power quantities, $P _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } }$ and $P _ { \\mathrm { r a d } } ,$ directly yields the limits  \n $$\nP _ { \\tau } ( \\omega ) \\leq \\frac { \\varepsilon _ { 0 } \\omega \\xi _ { \\tau } } { 2 } \\int _ { V } \\mathbf { F } _ { \\mathrm { i n } } ^ { \\dagger } \\overline { { \\overline { { \\chi } } } } ^ { \\dagger } ( \\mathrm { I m } \\overline { { \\overline { { \\chi } } } } ) ^ { - 1 } \\overline { { \\overline { { \\chi } } } } \\mathbf { F } _ { \\mathrm { i n c } } \\mathrm { d } V\n$$ \n where $\\tau \\in \\{ \\mathrm { r a d } , \\log \\}$ and $\\xi _ { \\tau }$ accounts for a variable radiative efficiency $\\eta$ (defined as the ratio of radiative to total energy loss): $\\xi _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } } = 1$ and $\\xi _ { \\mathrm { r a d } } = \\eta ( 1 - \\eta ) \\le 1 / 4$ . Hereafter, we consider isotropic and non-magnetic materials (and thus a scalar susceptibility $\\chi$ ), but the generalizations to anisotropic and/or magnetic media are straightforward.  \n Combining equations (2) and (3) yields a general limit on the loss or emission spectral probabilities $\\bar { T _ { \\tau } } ( \\omega ) = \\bar { P _ { \\tau } } ( \\omega ) / \\hbar \\omega$ :  \n $$\n\\Gamma _ { \\tau } ( \\omega ) \\leq \\frac { \\alpha \\xi _ { \\tau } c } { 2 \\pi \\omega ^ { 2 } } \\int _ { V } \\frac { \\left. \\chi \\right. ^ { 2 } } { \\mathrm { I m } \\chi } [ \\kappa _ { \\rho } ^ { 4 } K _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \\left( \\kappa _ { \\rho } \\rho \\right) + \\kappa _ { \\rho } ^ { 2 } k _ { \\nu } ^ { 2 } K _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \\left( \\kappa _ { \\rho } \\rho \\right) ] \\mathrm { d } V\n$$ \n where $\\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant. Equation (4) imposes, without solving Maxwell’s equations, a maximum rate of photon generation based on the electron velocity $\\beta$ (through $k _ { \\nu }$ and $\\kappa _ { \\rho } \\mathrm { , }$ , the material composition $\\chi ( \\mathbf { r } )$ and the volume $V .$ .  \n The limit in equation (4) can be further simplified by removing the shape dependence of $V$ , since the integrand is positive and is thus bounded above by the same integral for any enclosing structure. A scatterer separated from the electron by a minimum distance $d$ can be enclosed within a larger concentric hollow cylinder sector of inner radius $d$ and outer radius $\\infty$ ​. For such a sector (height $L$ and opening azimuthal angle $\\scriptstyle \\psi \\in ( 0 , 2 \\pi ] )$ , equation (4) can be further simplified, leading to a general closed-form shape-independent limit (see Supplementary Section 2) that highlights the pivotal role of the impact parameter $\\kappa _ { \\rho } d$ :  \n $$\nT _ { \\tau } ( \\omega ) \\leq \\frac { \\alpha \\xi _ { \\tau } } { 2 \\pi c } \\frac { | \\chi | ^ { 2 } } { \\mathrm { I m } \\chi } \\frac { L \\psi } { \\beta ^ { 2 } } [ ( \\kappa _ { \\rho } d ) K _ { 0 } ( \\kappa _ { \\rho } d ) K _ { 1 } ( \\kappa _ { \\rho } d ) ]\n$$ \n $$\n\\propto \\frac { 1 } { \\beta ^ { 2 } } \\Bigg \\{ \\ln ( 1 / \\kappa _ { \\rho } d ) \\mathrm { f o r } \\kappa _ { \\rho } d \\ll 1 ,\n$$ \n The limits of equations (4), (5a) and (5b) are completely general; they set the maximum photon emission and energy loss of an electron beam coupled to an arbitrary photonic environment in either the non-retarded or retarded regimes, given only the beam properties and material composition. The key factors that determine maximal radiation are identified: intrinsic material loss (represented by $\\mathrm { I m } \\chi \\dot { } ,$ ), electron velocity $\\beta$ and impact parameter $\\kappa _ { \\rho } d$ . The metric $| \\chi | ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { I m } \\chi$ reflects the influence of the material choice, which depends sensitively on the radiation wavelength (Fig. 1b). The electron velocity $\\beta$ also appears implicitly in the impact parameter $\\kappa _ { \\rho } d = k d / \\beta \\gamma ,$ showing that the relevant length scale is set by the relativistic velocity of the electron. The impact parameter $\\kappa _ { \\rho } d$ reflects the influence of the Lorentz contraction $d / \\gamma ;$ a well-known feature of both electron radiation and acceleration20,26,30.  \n A surprising feature of the limits in equations (4), (5a) and (5b) is their prediction for optimal electron velocities. As shown in Fig. 1c, when electrons are in the far field of the structure $( \\kappa _ { \\rho } d \\gg 1 )$ , stronger photon emission and energy loss are achieved by faster electrons—a well-known result. On the contrary, if electrons are in the near field $( \\kappa _ { \\rho } d \\ll 1 )$ , slower electrons are optimal. This contrasting behaviour is evident in the asymptotics of equation (5b), where the $1 / \\beta ^ { 2 }$ or $\\mathrm { e } ^ { - 2 \\kappa _ { \\rho } d }$ dependence is dominant at short or large separations. Physically, the optimal velocities are determined by the incident-field properties (equation (2)): slow electrons generate stronger near-field amplitudes although they are more evanescent (Supplementary Section 2). There has been recent interest in using low-energy electrons for Cherenkov10 and Smith–Purcell31 radiation; our prediction that they can be optimal at subwavelength interaction distances underscores the substantial technological potential of non-relativistic free-electron radiation sources.  \n The tightness of the limit (equations (4), (5a) and (5b)) is demonstrated by comparison with full-wave numerical calculations (see Methods) in Fig. 1d,e. Two scenarios are considered: in Fig. 1d, an electron traverses the centre of an annular Au bowtie antenna and undergoes antenna-enabled transition radiation $( \\eta \\approx 0 . 0 7 \\% )$ , while, in Fig. 1e, an electron traverses a Au grating, undergoing Smith–Purcell radiation $( \\eta \\approx 0 . 9 \\% )$ . In both cases, the numerical results closely trail the upper limit at the considered wavelengths, showing that the limits can be approached or even attained with modest effort.  \n  \n Next, we specialize in the canonical Smith–Purcell set-up illustrated in Fig. 1e inset. This set-up warrants a particularly close study, given its prominent historical and practical role in free-electron radiation. Aside from the shape-independent limit (equations (5a) and (5b)), we can find a sharper limit (in per unit length for periodic structure) specifically for Smith–Purcell radiation using rectangular gratings of filling factor $\\varLambda$ (see Supplementary Section 3)  \n $$\n\\frac { \\mathrm { d } { \\varGamma } _ { \\tau } ( \\omega ) } { \\mathrm { d } x } \\leq \\frac { \\alpha \\xi _ { \\tau } } { 2 \\pi c } \\frac { | \\boldsymbol \\chi | ^ { 2 } } { \\mathrm { I m } \\chi } \\varLambda \\mathcal { G } ( \\beta , k d )\n$$ \n The function ${ \\mathcal { G } } ( { \\boldsymbol { \\beta } } , k d )$ is an azimuthal integral (see Supplementary Section 3) over the Meijer G-function $G _ { 1 , 3 } ^ { 3 , 0 }$ (ref. $^ { 3 2 } )$ that arises in the radial integration of the modified Bessel functions $K _ { n }$ . We emphasize that equation (6) is a specific case of equation (4) for grating structures without any approximations and thus can be readily generalized to multi-material scenarios (see Supplementary equation (37)).  \n The grating limit (equation (6)) exhibits the same asymptotics as equations (5a) and (5b), thereby reinforcing the optimal-velocity predictions of Fig. 1c. The $( \\beta , k \\dot { d } )$ dependence of $\\mathcal { G }$ (see Fig. 2a) shows that slow (fast) electrons maximize Smith–Purcell radiation in the small (large) separation regime. We verify the limit predictions by comparison with numerical simulations: at small separations (Fig. 2b), radiation and energy loss peak at velocity $\\beta \\approx 0 . 1 5$ , consistent with the limit maximum; at large separations (Fig. 2c), both the limit and the numerical results grow monotonically with $\\beta$ .  \n The derived upper limit also applies to Cherenkov and transition radiation, as well as bulk loss in electron energy-loss spectroscopy. For these scenarios where electrons enter material bulk, a subtlety arises for the field divergence along the electron’s trajectory $( \\rho = 0$ in equation (2)) within a potentially lossy medium. This divergence, however, can be regularized by introducing natural, system-specific momentum cutoffs26, which then directly permits the application of our theory (see Supplementary Section 6). Meanwhile, there exist additional competing interaction processes (for example, electrons colliding with individual atoms). However, they typically occur at much smaller length scales.  \n We perform quantitative experimental measurement of Smith– Purcell radiation to directly probe the upper limit. Figure 3a shows our experimental set-up (see Methods and Supplementary Section 7 for details). A one-dimensional (1D) $5 0 \\%$ -filling-factor grating (Au-covered single-crystalline Si)—the quintessential Smith– Purcell set-up—is chosen as a sample, and shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Fig. $^ { 3 \\mathrm { b } , \\mathrm { c } }$ Free electrons pass above and impinge onto the sample at a grazing angle of $1 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ under 10 to $2 0 \\mathrm { k V }$ acceleration voltages.  \n Figure 3d depicts our measurements of first-order $m = 1$ Smith– Purcell radiation appearing at wavelengths between 500 and $7 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . In quantitative agreement with equation (1) evaluated at the normal emission angle (solid lines), the measured radiation spectra (dots) blueshift with increasing electron velocity. Notably, we experimentally obtain the absolute intensity of the collected radiation via a calibration measurement (see Supplementary Section 7). The upper limits (equation (4)) for the surface-normal emission wavelengths $\\left( \\lambda = a / \\beta \\right)$ are evaluated at the centre of the interaction region (height ${ \\approx } 1 4 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ $( k d \\approx 1 . 5 )$ , varying with beam energy), and is shown with shading in Fig. 3d to account for the thickness uncertainty $( \\pm 1 . 5 \\mathrm { n m } )$ . The envelope spanned by the measurement peaks follows the upper-limit lineshape across the visible spectrum: both the theoretical limit and the measured intensities peak near $5 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ and decrease in a commensurate manner for other wavelengths. This lineshape originates from two competing factors. At shorter wavelengths, the material factor $| \\chi | ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { I m } \\Dot { \\chi }$ decreases significantly for both Au and Si (see Fig. 1c), which accounts for the reduced radiation intensity. At longer wavelengths, the major constraint becomes the less efficient interaction between the electrons and the structure, as the electron-beam diameters increase for the reduced brightness of the electron gun (tungsten) at lower acceleration voltages (see Supplementary Section 7). These pieces of experimental evidence for the upper limit are at $k d \\approx 1 . 5$ (estimated from a geometrical raytracing model; see Supplementary Section 7), where fast electrons are still preferred (Fig. 2a). To further confirm our theory, we also conduct a near-infrared Smith–Purcell experiment (Supplementary Section 8) at $k d \\approx 1$ , where the envelope lineshape of the emission spectra again follows our prediction. We also obtain complementary supporting evidence (extracted from a recent work10) for our slowelectron-efficient prediction (see Supplementary Section 9).  \n  \n Finally, we turn our attention to an ostensible peculiarity of the limits: equation (4) evidently diverges for lossless materials $( \\mathrm { I m } \\chi \\to 0 ) \\dot { { \\frac { . } { . } } }$ ), seemingly providing little insight. On the contrary, this divergence suggests the existence of a mechanism capable of strongly enhancing Smith–Purcell radiation. Indeed, by exploiting high-Q resonances near bound states in the continuum (BICs)13 in photonic crystal slabs, we find that Smith–Purcell radiation can be enhanced by orders of magnitude, when specific frequency-, phaseand polarization-matching conditions are met.  \n A 1D silicon $\\left( \\chi = 1 1 . 2 5 \\right)$ -on-insulator $\\mathrm { \\ S i O } _ { 2 } ,$ $\\chi = 1 . 0 7 \\$ ) grating interacting with a sheet electron beam illustrates the core conceptual idea most clearly. The transverse electric (TE) $( E _ { x } , H _ { y } , E _ { z } )$ band structure (lowest two bands labelled $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 0 }$ and $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 . } ^ { \\cdot }$ ), matched polarization for a sheet electron beam (supplementary equation S41b)), is depicted in Fig. 4b along the $\\Gamma { \\mathrm { - } } \\mathrm { X }$ direction. Folded electron wavevectors, $k _ { \\nu } = \\omega / \\nu ,$ are overlaid for two distinct velocities (blue and green). Strong electron–photon interactions are possible when the electron and photon dispersions intersect: for instance, $k _ { \\nu }$ and the $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 0 }$ band intersect (grey circles) below the air light cone (light yellow shading). However, these intersections are largely impractical: the $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 0 }$ band is evanescent in the air region, precluding free-space radiation. Still, analogous ideas, employing similar partially guided modes, such as spoof plasmons33, have been explored for generating electron-enabled guided waves34,35.  \n To overcome this deficiency, we theoretically propose a new mechanism for enhanced Smith–Purcell radiation: coupling of electrons with $\\mathrm { B I C } s ^ { 1 3 }$ . The latter have the extreme quality factors of guided modes but are, crucially, embedded in the radiation continuum, guaranteeing any resulting Smith–Purcell radiation into the far field. By choosing appropriate velocities $\\beta = a / m \\lambda$ ( $m$ being any integer; $\\lambda$ being the BIC wavelength) such that the electron line (blue or green) intersects the $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 }$ mode at the BIC (red square in Fig. 4b), the strong enhancements of a guided mode can be achieved in tandem with the radiative coupling of a continuum resonance. In Fig. 4c, the incident fields of electrons and the field profile of the BIC indicate their large modal overlaps. The BIC field profile shows complete confinement without radiation, unlike conventional multipolar radiation modes (see Supplementary Fig. 9). The Q values of the resonances are also provided near a symmetry-protected $\\mathrm { B I C ^ { 1 3 } }$ at the $\\Gamma$ point. Figure 4d,e demonstrates the velocity tunability of BIC-enhanced radiation—as the phase matching approaches the BIC, a divergent radiation rate is achieved.  \n  \n The BIC-enhancement mechanism is entirely accordant with our upper limits. Practically, silicon has non-zero loss across the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. For example, for a period of $a = 6 7 6 \\mathrm { n m }$ , the optimally enhanced radiation wavelength is $\\approx 1 { , } 0 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , at which $\\chi _ { \\mathrm { s i } } \\approx 1 1 . 2 5 + 0 . 0 0 1 \\mathrm { i }$ (ref. 36). For an electron– structure separation of $3 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , we theoretically show in Fig. 4f the strong radiation enhancements ${ > } 3$ orders of magnitude) attainable by BIC-enhanced coupling. The upper limit (shaded region; 2D analogue of equation (4); see Supplementary Section 10) attains extremely large values due to the minute material loss $( | \\chi | ^ { 2 } / \\mathrm { I m } \\chi \\approx 1 0 ^ { 5 } )$ ; nevertheless, BIC-enhanced coupling enables the radiation intensity to closely approach this limit at several resonant velocities. In the presence of an absorptive channel, the maximum enhancement occurs at a small offset from the BIC where the $Q$ -matching condition (see Supplementary Section 11) is satisfied (that is, equal absorptive and radiative rates of the resonances).  \n In closing, we have theoretically derived and experimentally probed a universal upper limit to the energy loss and photon emission from free electrons. The limit depends crucially on the impact parameter $\\kappa _ { \\rho } d$ , but not on any other detail of the geometry. Hence, our limit applies even to the most complex metamaterials and metasurfaces, given only their constituents. Surprisingly, in the near field, slow electrons promise stronger radiation than relativistic ones. The limit predicts a divergent radiation rate as the material loss rate goes to zero, and we show that BIC resonances enable such staggering enhancements. This is relevant for the generation of coherent Smith–Purcell radiation14,34,35. The long lifetime, spectral selectivity and large field enhancement near a BIC can strongly bunch electrons, allowing them to radiate coherently at the same desired frequency, potentially enabling low-threshold Smith–Purcell freeelectron lasers. The combination of this mechanism and the optimal velocity prediction reveals prospects of low-voltage yet high-power free-electron radiation sources. In addition, our findings demonstrate a simple guiding principle to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio for electron energy-loss spectroscopy through an optimal choice of electron velocity, enabling improved spectral resolution.  \n The predicted slow-electron-efficient regime still calls for direct experimental validation. We suggest that field-emitter-integrated free-electron devices (for example, ref. 10) are ideal to confirm the prediction due to the achievable small electron–structure separation and high electron beam quality at relatively large currents. Alternatively, the microwave or terahertz frequencies could be suitable spectral ranges for verifying the slow-electron-efficient regime, where the subwavelength separation requirement is more achievable.  \n The upper limit demonstrated here is in the spontaneous emission regime for constant-velocity electrons, and can be extended to the stimulated regime by suitable reformulation. Stronger electron– photon interactions can change electron velocity by a non-negligible amount that alters the radiation. If necessary, this correction can be perturbatively incorporated. In the case of external optical pumping37, the upper limit can be revised by redefining the incident field as the summation of the electron incident field and the external optical field. From a quantum mechanical perspective, this treatment corresponds to stimulated emission from free electrons, which multiplies the limit by the number of photons in that radiation mode. This treatment could also potentially translate our limit into a fundamental limit for particle acceleration38,39, which is the time-reversal of free-electron energy loss and which typically incorporates intense laser pumping. In the multi-electron scenario, the radiation upper limit will be obtained in the case of perfect bunching, where all electrons radiate in phase. In this case, our singleelectron limit should be multiplied by the number of electrons to correct for the superradiant nature of such coherent radiation.  \n Methods  \n Methods, including statements of data availability and any associated accession codes and references, are available at https://doi. org/10.1038/s41567-018-0180-2  \n Received: 18 December 2017; Accepted: 17 May 2018; Published online: 16 July 2018  \n References   \n1.\t Cherenkov, P.

Yang2 1Institute of Advanced Science Facilities, Shenzhen, China 2Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Dalian, China  \n Abstract  \n Wakefield structures are broadly employed in free electron laser (FEL) facilities for beam manipulation. Compared with cylindrical geometries, planar structures are typically preferred due to their increased flexibility, allowing for tunable wakefield strength through gap adjustment. However, these planar configurations can induce time-dependent quadrupole wakefields, which require careful compensation in various applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel structure design incorporating four identical corrugated elements which are independently controllable. By adjusting the gaps between orthogonal pairs, the quadrupole wakefield can be either fully compensated to avoid emittance growth or significantly amplified to enhance beam mismatch for slice lasing control. This manuscript presents both the physical and mechanical design of the proposed structure, as well as the planned proof-of-principle experiment.  \n INTRODUCTION  \n Wakefields are induced when a charged bunch traverses a corrugated or dielectric pipe. Structure-based wakefield acceleration represents a promising approach to achieve gradients significantly higher than those attained by conventional techniques [1–3]. Furthermore, wakefield have been demonstrated to be effective tools for beam manipulation in FELs, where the short-range wakefield from the bunch head can alter the longitudinal or transverse momentum of the tail [4–18]. Initially, wakefield structures were employed in FELs as dechirpers to mitigate the linear energy chirp introduced for magnetic bunch compression [4, 5, 7]. Since then, these structures have been adapted for a broader range of applications, such as passive linearization [6, 13], slice lasing control [8, 10–12, 14, 15], and passive deflection [9, 17, 18].  \n The Shenzhen Superconducting Soft X-Ray Free-Electron Laser $( { \\mathrm { S } } ^ { 3 } { \\mathrm { F E L } } )$ is a newly proposed, high repetition-rate FEL facility featuring multiple undulator lines that lase in the $1 { - } 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ range [19]. Wakefield structures are under development to serve as dechirpers and as key components for advanced FEL modes. Their performance is crucial to achieving high lasing quality in $S ^ { 3 } \\mathrm { F E L }$ .  \n Most FEL facilities apply planar structures with two corrugated plates, where the longitudinal wakefield strength can be adjusted by varying the gap. However, quadrupole wakefield is introduced in addition to the longitudinal wakefield due to the asymmetric geometry. The time-dependent quadrupole wakefield can cause beam mismatch and emittance growth, which usually require compensation by placing two pairs of plates orthogonally and maintaining nearly symmetric average $\\beta$ functions throughout the structures [7]. Conversely, purposely enhancing beam mismatch via the quadrupole wakefield can be exploited for slice lasing control, by individually matching the slices into different undulators [10, 11]. Consequently, it would be desirable to introduce a structure that provides flexible and independent control of both longitudinal and quadrupole wakefield.  \n  \n Therefore, we propose a novel wakefield structure consisting of four identical elements. By adjusting the gaps between orthogonal pairs, the quadrupole wakefield can be either fully compensated or significantly amplified, while the impact to the longitudinal wakefield is moderate. Such design allows for flexible manipulation of bunch slice properties for various applications.  \n PHYSICAL DESIGN  \n The quadripartite wakefield structure comprises four identical corrugated plates, each independently controlled by a pair of high-precision motors, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The corrugation of each plate can be designed either as a quartercircle curve or flat, without affecting the fundamental working principle. In the following physical analysis, the curved configuration is employed with its key parameters listed in Table 1.  \n Table: Caption: Table 1: Parameters of the Quadripartite Wakefield Structure Body: <html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Value</td><td>Unit</td></tr><tr><td>Corrugation period p</td><td>0.5</td><td>mm</td></tr><tr><td>Corrugation length t</td><td>0.25</td><td>mm</td></tr><tr><td>Corrugation depth h</td><td>0.5</td><td>mm</td></tr><tr><td>Effective horizontal gap gx</td><td>1.4</td><td>mm</td></tr><tr><td>Effective vertical gap gy</td><td>1.4</td><td>mm</td></tr><tr><td>Slot length w</td><td>7</td><td>mm</td></tr><tr><td>Pipe radius a when fully closed</td><td>0.5</td><td>mm</td></tr></table></body></html> \n  \n ECHO3D [20] and CST wakefield solver [21] have been used to simulate the wakefield of the proposed structure, and their results have been benchmarkded against each other. Figure 2 and 3 illustrate the simulation results for an on-axis charged beam with a Gaussian temporal distribution and an rms bunch length of $1 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . When $g _ { x } = g _ { y }$ , the quadrupole wakefield is not induced due to the structure symmetry. Furthermore, compared to the planar structure using the same corrugation parameters $p , t$ , and $h$ , the quadripartite structure produces $\\sim 5 0 \\%$ stronger longitudinal wakefield, leading to a shorter required length to mitigate a given energy chirp. Conversely, when $g _ { x }$ is fixed as $1 . 4 \\mathrm { m m }$ and $g _ { y }$ is adjusted, the quadrupole wakefield can be significantly enhanced to either direction, while the variation in the longitudinal wakefield remains moderate.  \n MECHANICAL DESIGN  \n To fully leverage these advantages, the four corrugated plates must be positioned with high precision, making the mechanical design critical for the proposed structure. Consequently, a prototype structure (Fig. 4) featuring $1 \\mathrm { m }$ -long aluminium corrugation plates has been designed for beam test at Dalian Coherent Light Source (DCLS, Fig. 5) [22] to benchmark the simulation results and validate engineering aspects.  \n  \n For manufacturing simplicity, the corrugation has been designed as flat configuration, and each $1 \\mathrm { m }$ -long plate are divided into four $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { m }$ sections, which are bolted onto a main girder, as illustrated in Fig. 6. To match the realistic beam condition, $p , t$ , and $h$ are respectively designed to be $2 \\mathrm { m m }$ , $1 \\mathrm { m m }$ , and $1 \\mathrm { m m }$ , and the minimal effective gap is set to be $3 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . Alignment of the sections on the same girder will be achieved through precise trimming. Venting slots are incorporated into both the corrugation sections and the main girders to maintain ultra-high vacuum. With two $4 0 0 \\mathrm { L / s }$ ion pumps places at the ends, the vacuum inside the chamber is simulated to be better than $1 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \\ \\mathrm { P a }$ .  \n  \n Each ${ 1 \\mathrm { m } }$ -long plate is controlled by two synchronized high-precision motors. The misalignment between the main girders due to assembly, deforming, and motor position error is required to be less than $5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n PLANNED PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE EXPERIMENT  \n The proof-of-principle experiment is scheduled to be conducted in DCLS where low-emittance electron beam is produced by an S-band 1.6-cell photocathode RF gun and accelerated to $3 0 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ via six S-band $3 \\mathrm { m }$ -long linacs.  \n The prototype wakefield structure will be installed between the undulator beamline and the downstream diagnostics section. Diagnostics involved in the experiment will include a $1 2 \\mathrm { M V }$ S-band deflecting cavity, a dipole magnet with beam dump, and several beam profile monitors. In alignment with methodologies established in previous studies [5, 23], the longitudinal, dipole, and quadrupole wakefields will be inferred from the longitudinal phase space, beam tail offset, and slice transverse size, respectively. Beam dynamics simulation has been thoroughly conducted to obtain the proper lattice settings for the experiment.  \n CONCLUSION  \n A quadripartite wakefield structure comprising four identical corrugated elements has been proposed for FEL applications. The independently controllable plates enable a flexible configuration to control the longitudinal and quadrupole wakefields. A prototype structure has been designed and is currently under fabrication. The proof-of-principle experiment is scheduled to take place at DCLS in 2025.  \n "

This monitor, which is designed to have a submicrometer spatial resolution, is based on x-ray imaging optics composed of two FZPs. Various improvements were performed to the old setup. First, a new crystal monochromator was introduced to suppress the beam image drift. Second, the two FZP folders were improved in order to realize a precise beam-based alignment during x-ray imaging. Third, a fast mechanical shutter was installed to achieve a shorter time resolution, and an $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray mask system was also installed to obstruct direct synchrotron radiation through the FZPs. These improvements could make beam-profile measurements more precise and reliable. The beam profiles with less than $5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ horizontal beam size and less than $6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ vertical beam size could be measured within a 1 ms time duration.

INTRODUCTION  \n A. Introduction to the FZP monitor  \n The production of low-emittance beams is one of the key techniques for electron accelerators and synchrotron light sources. For example, a third-generation synchrotron light source and future synchrotron light sources, like an energy recovery linac (ERL), require an unnormalized emittance of a few nm rad or less (hereafter we redefine the word of ‘‘emittance’’ as ‘‘unnormalized emittance’’). In highenergy physics, the linear collider also requires such ultralow emittance beams to realize the necessary luminosity.  \n The Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) was built at High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in order to develop the key techniques of ultralow emittance beam generation and manipulation. The ATF consists of a $1 . 2 8 \\ \\mathrm { G e V }$ S-band electron linac, a damping ring, and an extraction line [1]. A low-emittance beam is generated in the ATF damping ring, where the horizontal emittance at a zero current is $1 . 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 9 }$ m rad. The target value of the vertical emittance at a zero current is $1 . 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 1 1 }$ m rad, which has been generated by applying precise vertical dispersion corrections and betatron-coupling corrections [2]. The typical beam sizes are less than $5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ horizontally and less than $1 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ vertically. Such small beam sizes cannot be measured by the typically used visible-light imaging optics for synchrotron radiation (SR) because of the large diffraction limit of visible light. Beam-profile monitoring with good spatial resolution is crucially important to confirm whether the required extremely small emittance beam is stably generated and manipulated. Therefore, there are some special monitors set and developed in the ATF: tungsten and carbon wire scanners in the extraction line, a double-slit SR interferometer, a laser wire monitor, and a Fresnel zone plate monitor.  \n  \n We briefly summarize the history of measurements of emittance in the ATF damping ring. First, the horizontal emittance was successfully measured by the tungsten and/ or carbon wire scanner set on the extraction line [3], and was also measured by a double-slit SR interferometer. However, the vertical emittance was not clearly measured with these monitors. In the case of the wire scanner, the spurious dispersion and coupling from the large horizontal emittance could be easily mixed with the vertical direction [4]. On the other hand, a vertical beam-size measurement by a double-slit SR interferometer, which used the spatial pattern of the interference of the visible SR passed through a double slit with an fixed interval [5], had an uncertainty because the measured vertical beam size in the ATF damping ring was almost at its resolution limit [6]. To avoid these uncertainties, a laser wire monitor was developed to measure directly the vertical beam size in the ATF damping ring [7]. This monitor is based on the Compton scattering of electrons with a thin laser light target, called a laser wire.  \n By scanning the laser wire instead of the solid tungsten and carbon wire, quasinondestructive measurements can be performed in the ATF damping ring, and the vertical emittance was successfully measured [8–10]. Unfortunately, we could measure the beam size only in one direction. Therefore, we did not know the $x$ -y coupling of the transverse beam profile. When there is a $x { - } y$ coupling in the transverse beam motion, the measured vertical beam size is contaminated by the horizontal one and the beam profile will become tilted by rotating toward the original two transverse directions perpendicular to the electron-beam motion. The vertical beam size cannot be measured precisely as long as the tilt of the beam profile caused by the $x \\cdot$ -y coupling is unknown. Furthermore, it takes several minutes to finish the measurement of the one directional beam size by the laser wire monitor. Thus, the effects of the beam drift and/or the mechanical vibration, which excites the beam motion of the same order as vertical beam size, cannot be removed off during the vertical beam-size measurement by the laser wire monitor. For precise beam-profile monitoring, it is necessary to know the beam image, which has much information about not only the horizontal and vertical beam sizes, but also the beam positions, beam current, tilt of the beam profile caused by the $x { - } y$ coupling, and its distribution, by direct monitoring of the beam image in a short time. This situation led us to develop a new beam-profile monitor based on $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray imaging optics by using Fresnel zone plates (FZPs).  \n The beam-profile monitor with x-ray imaging optics will allow precise and direct beam imaging in a nondestructive manner because the effect of the diffraction limit can be neglected by using x-ray SR. Some beam-profile monitors based on the x-ray imaging optics were performed by using FZP and a refractive $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray lens [11,12]. However, they used a knife-edge scanning technique to measure the beam profile because the beam image was reduced by using only one FZP or a single refractive $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray lens. Therefore, it took a long time to measure a beam profile. In order to overcome this defect, we proposed a real-time beam-profile monitor based on magnified $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray imaging optics using ‘‘two’’ FZPs (hereafter called as ‘‘FZP monitor’’) [13]. We originally developed the FZP monitor in the ATF damping ring to measure a small beam profile. For this purpose, the spatial resolution of this monitor was designed to be less than $1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . With this FZP monitor, we succeeded to obtain a clear electron-beam image enlarged by 20 times with two FZPs on an x-ray CCD, and measuring an extremely small electron-beam size of less than $1 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ [14]. Recently, a beam-profile monitor using a single FZP and an $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray zooming tube has been developed at the SPring-8 storage ring [15]. In this monitor, the magnified beam image was also obtained by using an $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray zooming tube, where x rays were converted to photoelectrons before magnification. It has a small spatial resolution of $4 \\mu \\mathrm m$ . With this monitor at the SPring-8 storage ring, $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray images of the electron beam were clearly obtained, and the vertical beam size with $1 4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in root mean square (rms) was successfully measured with a 1 ms time duration.  \n  \n B. Motivation for the improvements  \n There are several motivations for the improvements. First of all, to obtain long-term position stability of the beam image on an $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD, a new Si monochromator was installed to suppress the beam image drift. Second, the effect of aberrations due to a misalignment of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray imaging optics was not estimated and compensated in the FZP monitor because the center of $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray SR could not be detected with the x-ray CCD camera by intercepting the FZPs with fixed folders. The measured beam profile with the FZP monitor was sometimes deviated from a Gaussian distribution. However, we could not conclude whether the observed non-Gaussian character was caused by instrumental aberration or was a real feature of the beam itself. To eliminate the aberrations of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray imaging optics due to misalignment, two FZP folders were newly installed. Third, penetrated $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ rays through two FZPs, which appeared on the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD as a square of $3 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\times 3 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ reflecting the FZP structure, is one of the background components of the FZP monitor and affect the beam-profile measurement. In order to reduce this background, an $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray mask system has been installed. Finally, we improved the time resolution for reducing any short-term movements of the monitor and/or beam oscillation. Especially the AC line noise might affect the beam oscillation. In the original setup of the FZP monitor, the minimum exposure time was $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ ; therefore, the obtained beam images with different centers might be superposed by the AC line noise effect on the x-ray CCD. In order to remove the effect of short-term movement, like AC line noise and perform precise beam-profile measurements, a new fast mechanical shutter with a shorter exposure time was installed.  \n This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly present the principle of the FZP monitor. In Sec. III, we show the experimental setup of the FZP monitor, especially the improvements. Some measurement results by using the improved FZP monitor are shown in Sec. IV. The last section is devoted to conclusions.  \n II. PRINCIPLE OF FZP MONITOR  \n In this section, we briefly summarize the theoretical aspects of the FZP monitor and its resolution. (See Ref. [14] for details.)  \n A. X-ray imaging optics  \n The principle of a beam-profile measurement is as follows. The FZP monitor is based on the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray imaging optics with two FZPs, a condenser zone plate (CZP), and a microzone plate (MZP). It has the structure of a longdistance microscope, as shown in Fig. 1. When the electron beam emits $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray SR light, the transverse electron-beam image is magnified on the focal plane by using this optics. The magnification, $M$ , of the imaging optics is determined by $M = M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } \\times M _ { \\mathrm { M Z P } }$ , where $M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } }$ and $M _ { \\mathrm { M Z P } }$ are the magnifications of CZP and MZP. $M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } }$ and $M _ { \\mathrm { M Z P } }$ are basically defined as $M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } = L _ { \\mathrm { C 2 } } / L _ { \\mathrm { C 1 } }$ , where $L _ { C 1 }$ is the length from the SR source point to the CZP and $L _ { C 2 }$ is from the CZP to the intermediate focal point; $M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } =$ $L _ { M 2 } / L _ { M 1 }$ , where $L _ { M 1 }$ is the length from the intermediate focal point to the MZP and $L _ { M 2 }$ is from the MZP to a final focal point on an $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD, as shown in Fig. 1. The imaging optics should be designed and optimized so that the required spatial resolution and magnification are obtained.  \n  \n In the case of our monitor, we set $L _ { C 1 } = 1 0 \\mathrm { m }$ , $L _ { C 2 } =$ $1 \\mathrm { m }$ , $L _ { M 1 } = 2 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and $L _ { M 2 } = 5 \\mathrm { m }$ which resulted in $M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } = 1 / 1 0$ and $M _ { \\mathrm { M Z P } } = 2 0 0$ . The total magnification $M$ was $M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } \\times M _ { \\mathrm { M Z P } } = 1 / 1 0 \\times 2 0 0 = 2 0$ . Then a 20- times magnified beam image was obtained on the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD camera in our setup.  \n B. Fresnel zone plate  \n Before estimating the spatial resolution of the FZP monitor, we introduce the fundamental characteristics of an FZP here. The radius of the nth zone of the FZP is expressed by  \n $$\nr _ { n } = { \\sqrt { n f \\lambda } } ,\n$$ \n where the $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of a photon and $f$ is the focal length for the wavelength. The spatial resolution $\\delta$ which is the transverse size of a point-source image for the 1st-order diffraction on the focal plane, is determined by  \n $$\n\\delta = 1 . 2 2 \\Delta r _ { N } ,\n$$ \n where $\\Delta r _ { N }$ is the width of the outermost zone and the suffix $N$ means the total number of zones. If $N \\gg 1$ , it can be expressed as  \n $$\n\\Delta r _ { N } = f \\lambda / 2 r _ { N } = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\sqrt { \\frac { \\lambda f } { N } } .\n$$ \n The spatial resolution $\\delta$ of FZP corresponds to the distance between the center and the first-zero position of the Airy diffraction pattern. When we apply a Gaussian distribution with the standard deviation $\\sigma$ to its Airy diffraction pattern, the spatial resolution $\\delta$ almost equals the $3 \\sigma$ distance $( \\delta \\simeq 3 \\sigma )$ .  \n C. Expected spatial resolution of the FZP monitor  \n In order to measure a small beam profile, the spatial resolution of the FZP monitor must be smaller than the beam size. The total spatial resolution of the FZP monitor is determined by three mechanisms. One is the diffraction limit of $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray SR light. Another is the Airy diffraction pattern of FZP, as described in Eqs. (2) and (3). The other is the pixel-size of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera, itself. We summarize the spatial resolution determined by each parameter in Table I.  \n The diffraction limit is determined by the wavelength of x-ray SR $\\lambda = 0 . 3 8 3 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ , which corresponds to $3 . 2 4 \\mathrm { k e V } \\mathrm { x } .$ - ray energy, and the divergence angle $\\sigma _ {  { \\mathrm { S R } } }$ of $1 2 6 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { r a d }$ , which is obtained from the bending field of the ATF damping ring. Airy diffraction patterns of the FZPs also determine the limit of the measurable beam size. The image of the point source focused by each FZP has a finite width of the Airy diffraction pattern $\\delta$ as shown in Sec. II B. The spatial resolution, determined by CZP (MZP), is $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } / \\bar { M } _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } }$ ${ \\bf \\omega } _ { \\mathrm { \\left( \\sigma _ { M Z P } / \\it M \\right) } }$ . The outermost zone widths, $\\Delta r _ { N }$ , of CZP and MZP are listed in Table II. These $\\Delta r _ { N }$ ’s were limited by the fabrication technology, and the outermost zone width could not be reduced by less than $1 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ [16]. However, we note that the effect of the Airy pattern on the spatial resolution is also less than $1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . Finally, we need to consider the pixel size of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera. When one CCD pixel is $\\Delta x \\times \\Delta x$ square, its resolution, $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { C C D } }$ , is $\\Delta x / 2 \\sqrt { 3 }$ in rms. Then, the measurable beam size is determined by $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { C C D } } / M$ . In our monitor, one pixel is $2 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\times$ $2 4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ square, as shown in Table III. The spatial resolution determined by the CCD pixel size $( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { C C D } } / M )$ is $0 . 3 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in rms. The total spatial resolution is estimated from the sum of squares of these resolutions. The expected total spatial resolution of this monitor results in about $0 . 7 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in rms. Submicron spatial resolution is expected for this FZP monitor.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I. Expected spatial resolution of each parameter and the total expected spatial resolution.

IMPROVEMENTS ON THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  \n In this section, we present the setup of FZP monitor while concentrating on the improvements of the present setup compared to the former setup referred to as ‘‘old setup’’ in the following.  \n A. Experimental layout  \n Figure 2 shows the setup of the FZP monitor. SR light is extracted at the bending magnet (BM1R.27) just before the south straight section in the $1 . 2 8 \\mathrm { G e V }$ ATF damping ring, where the horizontal beam size is expected to be about $5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and the vertical beam size is expected to be less than $1 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . This system consists of a Si crystal monochromator, two FZPs (CZP and MZP), and an $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD camera. The specifications of the two FZPs are summarized in Table II. A beryllium window with $5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thickness is installed to isolate the relatively low vacuum of the monitor beam line from that of the ATF damping ring. $3 . 2 4 \\mathrm { k e V }$ x-ray SR light is selected by the Si(220) crystal monochromator with a Bragg angle, $\\theta _ { B }$ , of $8 6 . 3 5 ^ { \\circ }$ . The CZP and MZP are mounted on folders set on movable stages in order to align these two optical components precisely across the beam direction. Furthermore, the MZP folder can move in the longitudinal direction of the beam line to search the focal point of the MZP. The monochromatized $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray SR is precisely focused on the xray CCD camera by adjusting the positions of the two FZP (CZP and MZP) folders. The magnifications of the FZPs, $M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } }$ , and $M _ { \\mathrm { M Z P } }$ , are $1 / 1 0$ and 200, respectively. Therefore, an image of the electron beam at the bending magnet is magnified with a factor of 20 on the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD camera. The specifications of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera (C4880-21, HAMAMATSU) are summarized in Table III. The data taking timing of the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD camera is synchronized with the beam-injection timing in order to detect a beam image during the beam operation, in which the electron beam stayed within only $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m s } }$ associated with $1 . 5 6 \\ \\mathrm { H z }$ repetition of a beam injection in the ATF damping ring. A mechanical shutter is installed in front of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera to avoid irradiating x-ray SR on the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera during data transfer. The minimum shutter opening time of this shutter is $2 0 \\mathrm { m s }$ . A new fast mechanical shutter is set between the CZP and the MZP to improve the time resolution of the FZP monitor. A detailed description of the performance is given in Sec. III D.  \n  \n B. Si monochromator  \n The Si crystal monochromator can be rotated horizontally by using a goniometer and vertically by using a stepping motor, which is attached to the support of a Si crystal in a vacuum. With the old monochromator, the vertical position of the beam image on the CCD camera had largely drifted because the support of the Si crystal was deformed by heat from the stepping motor. In order to avoid any drift, a new Si crystal monochromator was produced. Figure 3 shows a picture of the new monochromator. In the new monochromator, a stepping motor was thermally isolated from the Si crystal by ceramic insulators and thermally stabilized by copper lines connected with a water-cooled copper plate. Figure 4 shows measurements of the beam centroid by the old and new monochromator, respectively. After this improvement, the drift was drastically reduced by a factor of about 100 and stabilized within a few $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for a long time, as shown in Fig. 4.  \n C. Fresnel zone plate  \n The new FZP folders were designed and fabricated so that the FZPs could be controlled and removed from the optical path in the vacuum if necessary. The removed FZPs are protected from the air pressure during any leaks in maintenance and repair of the monitor beam line, or the installation of new beam line components. The FZPs have never been damaged by air pressure during vacuum work since the new FZP folders were installed. Furthermore, the new folders allowed us to establish a more precise beambased alignment scheme by using only the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera. A precise alignment of the FZP monitor component is crucial to avoid degradation of the spatial resolution due to aberration. The alignment procedure was greatly improved with respect to the old setup: first the center position of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray beam reflected by the Si crystal (corresponding to the position of the optical axis) is measured with the x-ray CCD without FZP imaging. After that, the CZP is inserted to the optical path and the CZP position is adjusted to the optical axis. After inserting the CZP on the optical path, a clear image of the CZP can be detected by illumination of the raw $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray SR light, and hence the center position of the CZP can be obtained. Figure 5 shows an image of a raw $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray SR detected by the x-ray CCD and an image of the CZP on the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD after inserting the CZP. The MZP position is also adjusted in the same manner. The minimum alignment error can be one pixel of the CCD $( 2 4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ for the CZP and $1 / 2 0 0$ (the reciprocal of the MZP magnification $M _ { \\mathrm { M Z P , } }$ ) of one pixel for the MZP. The FZP tilt angle to the optical path is decided mainly by the machining accuracy and estimated to be less than $0 . 5 ^ { \\circ }$ . We note that the effect of these aberrations of the FZP monitor is calculated by not only ray-tracing analysis, but also the wave optics [17,18].  \n  \n D. Fast mechanical shutter  \n 1. Layout  \n The time resolution of this monitor is determined by the minimum shutter opening time of the mechanical shutter. We newly install a fast mechanical shutter in the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray beam line in order to improve the time resolution to less than $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m s } }$ . Figure 6 shows a block diagram of the FZP monitor after installation. The minimum opening time of the mechanical shutter is determined by the aperture.  \n Therefore, we applied a fast mechanical shutter with a $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ diameter aperture (UHS1ZM2, VINCENT), which is a factor 5 smaller than the shutter located, in the old setup, in front of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera. This shutter was installed $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m m } }$ upstream of the intermediate focal point of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray imaging optics between two FZPs so as not to scrape off the image of the transverse beam profile. The fast mechanical shutter was housed in a vacuum chamber and can be moved across the beam line by movable stages attached to this vacuum chamber. In addition, this shutter can be removed out from the optical path by the air cylinder if necessary.  \n This fast shutter has two modes. One is the ‘‘NORMAL’ mode, where the shutter opening time is determined by the input transistor-transistor logic (TTL) pulse width fed into the shutter controller. Another is the ‘‘HIGH’’ mode, where the shutter opening time is fixed to $0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ and synchronized with the input TTL trigger timing. These modes are changed by a shutter controller. A beam-injection timing signal is divided and provided into the CCD trigger signal (‘‘ch1’’ in Fig. 6) and the shutter trigger (‘‘ch2’’ in Fig. 6) via a function synthesizer. The timing of the fast mechanical shutter is synchronized with the beam-injection timing of the damping ring. The shutter opening time is controlled by changing the trigger pulse width set by the function synthesizer. Both the trigger timing and the timing delay between the fast shutter and $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD signal are also independently changed and set by this function synthesizer. On the other hand, the previous shutter trigger timing was adjusted to only the CCD internal trigger timing and controlled by the CCD controller via a PC.  \n 2. Performance  \n Prior to installation of the fast mechanical shutter, the performance of this shutter was measured on a test bench. The setup of the test bench is shown in Fig. 7. The shutter opening time was controlled by a TTL pulse produced by a pulse generator through the power supply and controller. Only when the shutter was open, the continuous-wave laser light through the shutter was detected by a Si p-i-n photodiode. The fast mechanical shutter opening time was estimated by measuring the width of the signal of the photodiode via an oscilloscope. Figure 8 shows the measured shutter opening time in the NORMAL mode as a function of the input TTL pulse width. The measurement was performed with $1 \\ \\mathrm { H z }$ repetition. The opening time is given by the full-width half maximum of the measured pulse width detected by $\\mathrm { S i } p$ -i-n photodiode. The measured shutter opening time follows the input TTL pulse width down to $1 \\mathrm { m s }$ , but it is saturated at less than 1 ms TTL pulse width. We then found that the minimum shutter opening time of this new shutter was 1 ms in the NORMAL mode. We also measured the shutter opening time in the HIGH mode, and the $0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ shutter opening time was obtained. These values are consistent with the catalogue values of the minimum shutter opening time in both the NORMAL and HIGH modes. The NORMAL mode was mainly used in beam-profile measurement, unless otherwise noted. We note that this shutter performance was kept stable for at least one day in this test bench.  \n E. X-ray pinhole mask  \n The background on the CCD image mainly consists of the readout noise of the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD circuit and the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray beam transmitted through the FZPs, which is not focused at all. The transmitted x rays through the MZP appear on the x-ray CCD as a square of about $3 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\times 3 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ , reflecting its MZP structure. Because the transmitted $\\mathbf { X }$ ray depended on the beam current, we needed to prepare background data of each beam current in the old setup to subtract the background component. In order to reduce the background component of the transmitted $\\mathbf { X }$ ray, an $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray mask system with a pinhole was installed near the fast mechanical shutter. The $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray mask was made of stainless steel and can be moved in the horizontal and vertical directions. Figure 9 shows the CCD images before and after insertion of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray mask with the pinhole diameter of $3 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The size of the background area was greatly reduced by using this $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray mask.  \n  \n IV. MEASUREMENT OF THE ULTRALOW EMITTANCE BEAM IN THE ATF DAMPING RING  \n A. Beam tuning and condition  \n We obtained a data set of the beam profile mainly for three days with various damping-ring conditions after improving the FZP monitor. In all cases the ATF ring was operated at $1 . 2 8 \\mathrm { G e V }$ in single-bunch mode. Typical stored beam current in the ATF damping ring is above $3 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m A }$ , which corresponds to $1 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { \\hat { 1 0 } }$ electrons per bunch, during beam-profile measurements. Before the measurement, the electron beam in the ATF damping ring was tuned as follows. First, the closed-orbit distortion and verticalmomentum dispersion were reduced as much as possible. Second, the coupling between the horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations was minimized by optimizing two sets of skew magnets wound around two series of sextupole magnets, respectively. This process, called ‘‘skew correction,’’ is a key to production of a low-emittance beam [19]. In 2005, a study of the effect by damping wigglers set on the two straight sections in the ATF damping ring was started [20]. We also studied the effect of the damping wigglers on the damping time by using the improved FZP monitor. The measurement dates and beam conditions are listed below.  \n (i) A skew correction was carefully carried out to make the vertical emittance as small as possible. The damping wigglers were turned off. We examined the basic performance of the upgraded FZP monitor and measured the beam profile. The damping time was also measured $( 2 0 0 5 / 4 / 8 )$ . (ii) The damping wigglers were turned on. A skew correction was also carefully carried out. The damping time was measured with the damping wigglers $( 2 0 0 5 / 4 / 1 3 )$ . (iii) The damping wigglers were turned off. The skew magnets were toggled to measure the beam profiles on the different coupling conditions after a skew correction was carefully carried out $( 2 0 0 5 / 6 / 1 )$ .  \n In order to show the beam conditions for these three days in detail, we summarize the parameters of the ATF damping ring for three days in Table IV. The measurements of only the relevant parameters will be briefly given. The $\\beta$ function at source point of the FZP monitor, where $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray SR was emitted, was measured as follows. By changing the strength of a quadrupole near the source point, we measured any change of the betatron tune with beam position monitors (BPMs). This tune variation is related to the $\\beta$ function at the quadrupole magnet. We measured the $\\beta$ functions at three quadrupole magnets and these $\\beta$ functions were used to evaluate the $\\beta$ function at the source point with the help of a ring’s lattice model. Dispersions $\\eta _ { x }$ and $\\eta _ { y }$ were measured directly by monitoring the change of the beam image center related to the change of the rf frequency. The measured vertical dispersions were less than $\\pm 1 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . The momentum spread $\\sigma _ { p } / p$ was measured by observing the electron-beam size with a screen monitor at the extraction line, where the dispersion was very large [3]. Because of the worse beam tuning and condition at the extraction line, we could not measure the momentum spread, except on $2 0 0 5 / 4 / 8$ . The measured momentum spread on $2 0 0 5 / 4 / 8$ was $8 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ at the beam current of $3 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { m A }$ . The current dependence of the measured momentum spread will be shown later.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE IV. Summary of the parameters of the damping ring (measured value). The $x$ (y) in the second column of parameters denotes the horizontal (vertical) direction of each parameter (Tune, $\\beta$ function, and dispersion function).

Measurement of beam profiles by the improved FZP monitor  \n 1. Data taking procedures  \n Prior to a beam-profile measurement, the following procedures were carried out to adjust the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray optics in the monitor. First, in order to detect raw x-ray SR on the xray CCD camera, the two FZPs and the fast mechanical shutter in the vacuum were removed off from the optical path. After that, a new alignment method was applied, as described in Sec. III C. The fast mechanical shutter and the x-ray mask were also inserted into on the optical path after searching the beam image and adjusting the transverse position across the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray beam line so that the measured beam image would not be scraped off. The shutter timing and opening time were optimized depending on the experimental conditions. Finally, the longitudinal position of the MZP was scanned in order to focus the beam image on the x-ray CCD camera.  \n As the shutter opening time becomes shortened, the background component becomes larger than the peak signal of the obtained beam image. In order to measure the beam profiles precisely and analyze them in detail, we carefully subtracted this background component from the data of $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD, as follows. The transverse position of the beam image is much more sensitive, by a factor of 200 of the magnification of MZP, than a transverse change of the MZP. Thanks to the newly installed x-ray pinhole mask, the area of the transmitted x ray, which is one of the background, is drastically reduced. Therefore, by changing the transverse position of the MZP by only a few microns vertically, the beam image does not overlap the transmitted x ray. The alignment error of this position change of the MZP is too small to deform the obtained beam image on the x-ray CCD by the effect of aberrations. After changing the position of the MZP, the background of $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD is subtracted. These procedures for background subtraction allow us to measure the beam profiles easily and precisely.  \n  \n Figure 10 shows a measured beam image after background subtraction. The shutter opening time was fixed with $1 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ . A clear beam image was observed on the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera. This beam image, as shown in Fig. 10, was obtained by superposing 10 different beam images with the same current and same trigger timing from beam injection after background subtraction in order to gain the signal-tonoise ratio. The horizontal and vertical beam profiles were obtained by projecting the beam image to each direction. In  \n FIG. 10. (Color) Typical beam image obtained by the FZP monitor after the background was subtracted. Beam current was a $4 . 4 \\mathrm { \\ m A }$ in a single-bunch mode. The shutter opening time was fixed to $1 \\ \\mathrm { m s }$ . The horizontal and vertical bars of $5 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ show the scales at the source point.  \n order to determine the horizontal and vertical beam sizes, we fitted each beam profile to a Gaussian curve with four parameters of its center, width, peak height, and offset. The horizontal and vertical beam profiles and their fitted Gaussian curves are shown in Fig. 11. The horizontal axes in Fig. 11 show the beam positions, which were converted to the scale at the source point by dividing the magnification factor $M = 2 0$ . The measured horizontal and vertical beam sizes were about $5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and about $6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for three measurements.  \n 2. Shutter opening time dependence of the measured beam size  \n The measured beam size can be increased by mechanical vibrations and/or jitter coming from electrical noises. In order to study these effects, we measured the dependence of the beam sizes on the shutter opening time prior to a precise beam-profile measurement. Figure 12 shows the measured horizontal and vertical beam sizes as a function of the shutter opening time. The beam current was fixed to $4 \\mathrm { \\ m A }$ during these measurements. The error bar was mainly due to the fitting error assuming a Gaussian, as described in Sec. IV B 1. We found that the measured horizontal beam size was almost $5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , and was independent of the shutter opening time. On the other hand, the vertical beam size was changed from 9 to $7 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ by shortening the shutter opening time from 4 to $1 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ or less. In order to investigate this enhancement, we measured the image center of the CCD as a function of the trigger time of the fast mechanical shutter from beam injection with a fixed opening time. Figure 13 shows the dependences of the measured horizontal and vertical beam image centers as a function of the shutter trigger time with $1 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ shutter opening time. All of the data were obtained in the radiation equilibrium of the ATF damping ring. We found the horizontal and vertical oscillations of the beam position. Both oscillations were well fitted to a sinusoidal curve with $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ frequency. We note that the position oscillation was also found at $4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m s } }$ after beam injection with the same amplitude and the same phase of $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ frequency. Furthermore, when we measured the beam profiles 10 times with the same shutter trigger timing, this oscillation was reproduced within these error bars. These results mean that the image center was clearly oscillating with the $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ frequency in the synchronization with the injection timing. To translate the image center oscillation to the beam oscillation, with amplitude $A _ { b }$ , the sinusoidal function was magnified with the magnification factor $M = 2 0$ of the FZP monitor. These beam oscillation amplitudes were found to be $A _ { b } = 1 4 . 9 \\pm 1 . 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ horizontally and $A _ { b } = 7 . 8 4 \\pm 0 . 4 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ vertically. The vertical beam oscillation significantly affects the beam size because the vertical oscillation is of the same order as the vertical beam size. From these measurements, we concluded that the vertical $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ oscillation caused a vertical beam-size enhancement.  \n  \n  \n This $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ oscillation was also found from data taken on 2 other different days with almost the same amplitudes and phases. In order to eliminate the $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ oscillation from the measurement, we fixed the shutter opening time to 1 ms and adjusted the shutter trigger timing to an optimum phase condition of the $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ oscillation in all of the beam-profile measurements. We note that we did not use the HIGH mode with a $0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ shutter opening time from the view point of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, whenever we measured the beam profiles by the FZP monitor, we superposed ten beam profiles on the xray CCD in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio more.  \n  \n In order to survey the source of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ oscillation, we checked all of the components of the FZP monitor: two FZPs, the Si crystal monochromator, and the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD. First, mechanical vibrations of the two FZPs, including their folders, were measured at frequencies below $1 2 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ with a compact seismometer (VSE-15D Tokyo Sokushin Co.). Figure 14 shows the measurement results of vertical vibrations of the two FZP folders. The cumulative displacement at each frequency is defined by a square root of the displacement power spectrum integrated from the frequency up to $1 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ . We found a $5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ rms displacement of the CZP and $4 \\mathrm { n m }$ rms displacement of the MZP at $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ frequency, as shown in Fig. 14. The scaled displacements at the source point due to the CZP and MZP displacements of $\\Delta y$ , are expressed as $( 1 + 1 / M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } ) \\Delta y$ and $( 1 / M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } ) \\Delta y$ , respectively. In our case $ { M _ { \\mathrm { C Z P } } } = 1 / 1 0$ and $M _ { \\mathrm { { M Z P } } } = 2 0 0 )$ ), they are $1 1 \\Delta y$ and $1 0 \\Delta y$ . Assuming the observed vibrations, 55 and $4 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ beam oscillations are expected by the CZP and the MZP, respectively. These values are too small to explain the $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ beam oscillation with the vertical amplitude, $A _ { b }$ , of $7 . 8 4 \\pm 0 . 4 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, the vibrations of the FZPs are not the reason for the $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ oscillation of the beam center. Second, we doubted that the Si crystal monochromator might vibrate at $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ through its power supply of the motor and goniometer. For a confirmation, we remeasured the shutter opening time dependence when the power supply of the stepping motor and goniometer attached with Si monochromator were turned off. Figure 15 shows the shutter opening time dependence of the vertical beam sizes. The solid boxes (open circles) show the data when the power supply was turned off (on). We found a vertical beam-size enhancement by increasing the shutter opening time on both cases, as shown in Fig. 12. No clear difference between both conditions was observed. Finally, we measured the x-ray SR illuminated image of the CZP on the xray CCD camera, as shown in the right picture of Fig. 5 by changing the trigger timing of the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD camera. If the beam image oscillation is due to any vibration of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD camera, itself, we will also see a similar oscillation of the image of CZP because it does not follow the beam motion without focusing. We found no image oscillation of more than 1 pixel of the x-ray CCD camera horizontally and vertically, in spite of changing the trigger timing every 1 ms from 0 to $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { { m s } }$ with a $1 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ shutter opening time.  \n  \n  \n From these measurements, we conclude that the beamsize enhancement, especially vertically, is caused by the $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ oscillation; the FZP monitor, itself, is working well, and electron beam might be oscillated with $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ frequency.  \n 3. Data analysis and results  \n For data analysis, fitting with a two-dimensional Gauss function was applied to the beam images. We set 7 free parameters with horizontal and vertical centers, horizontal and vertical widths, peak height, the tilt angle, and the offset. The positive direction of tilt angle was counterclockwise to the electron-beam motion. The fitting results of the horizontal beam size $\\sigma _ { x }$ , vertical beam size $\\sigma _ { y }$ , and tilt angle $\\theta _ { b }$ are summarized in Table V for three different days after the skew correction. The two sets of data (named as ‘‘1st’’ and ‘‘2nd’’) were taken on $2 0 0 5 / 6 / 1$ . The 1st data were taken after first making a skew correction. To confirm the reproducibility, skew magnets were turned off once, and turned on again; 2nd data on $2 0 0 5 / 6 / 1$ were taken under this condition. The shutter opening time was fixed at  \n Table: Caption: TABLE V. Summary of the measured beam sizes, the tilt angles, and vertical emittances by the FZP monitor.

The beam size and the tilt angle errors were mainly due to the fitting errors, so that the reduced- $\\chi ^ { 2 }$ was unity. All of the beam sizes by the two-dimensional Gauss function fitting agree well with those of the onedimensional fitting on each projected direction, as described in Sec. IV B 1. All of the data show a similar current dependence, except for the data taken on $2 0 0 5 / 4 / 1 3$ . The measured horizontal and vertical beam sizes and tilt angles were distributed between 45 and $5 1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , between 5.9 and $6 . 6 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , and between 0 and $1 . 2 ^ { \\circ }$ , respectively, when the damping wigglers were turned off. When the damping wigglers were turned on, the tilt angle became larger than that without the damping wigglers. This difference might suggest that beam tuning with skew magnets was not well done when the damping wigglers were turned on.  \n One of our interests is to confirm the generation of the low-emittance beam, especially vertical emittance in the damping ring. The measured vertical beam size $( \\sigma _ { y } )$ and the vertical emittance $( \\varepsilon _ { y } )$ are related by  \n $$\n\\beta _ { y } \\varepsilon _ { y } = ( \\sigma _ { y } ) ^ { 2 } - \\biggl ( \\eta _ { y } \\frac { \\sigma _ { p } } { p } \\biggr ) ^ { 2 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\beta _ { y }$ and $\\eta _ { y }$ are, respectively, the ring’s $\\beta$ function and the dispersion function in the $y$ direction at the source point, and $\\sigma _ { p } / p$ is the momentum spread. We note that, from Table IV, the term $\\eta _ { \\mathrm { y } } ( \\sigma _ { p } / p )$ contributes less than $1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , and that it can be neglected compared with the measured beam sizes $( \\sigma _ { y } )$ of about $6 \\mu \\mathrm m$ , as shown in Table V. Finally, we used Eq. (4) in order to evaluate $\\varepsilon _ { y }$ ; the results are listed in the 6th column of Table V. From these results, when low-emittance tuning was carefully done, the measured vertical emittance was found to be about 11 pm rad for above $3 \\mathrm { m A }$ in the single-bunch mode.  \n Beam emittance in the ATF damping ring is dominated by the intrabeam scattering effect [2]. In a high current of the single-bunch mode, the emittance increases as the beam current become high, and the coupling ratio decreases. In order to estimate the coupling ratio of the ATF damping ring and validate these measured beam sizes, we compared the measured beam sizes with calculation obtained by using the optics data of the ATF damping ring in Table IV and the computer program SAD [21] including the intrabeam scattering effect [22,23]. Figure 16 shows comparisons of the measured beam size (boxes) and the calculation (lines) on $2 0 0 5 / 4 / 8$ . Figure 17 also shows the data of the measured data (boxes and circles) and calculation (lines) on $2 0 0 5 / 6 / 1$ . The horizontal axes show the beam current of the damping ring in the single-bunch mode, and the vertical axes are the measured and calculated beam sizes. These two measurements agree well with the calculation when it is assumed that the coupling ratio is $( 0 . 5 \\pm 0 . 1 ) \\%$ and are almost consistent with the other measurement by the laser wire monitor in the ATF damping ring, described in Ref. [2]. In order to confirm the assumption of coupling ratio, the energy spread was also measured. Figure 18 shows the measured energy spread at the extraction line on $2 0 0 5 / 4 / 8$ . The errors of the measured momentum spread at higher beam current are mainly caused by the measurement error of the dispersion function at the screen monitor. On the other hand, the errors of the momentum spread at lower beam current are mainly caused by the statistical error because of the poor signal of the screen monitor. As shown in Fig. 18, the measured energy spread at the extraction line on $2 0 0 5 / 4 / 8$ also agrees well with a calculation under the assumption of a $( 0 . 5 \\pm 0 . 1 ) \\%$ coupling ratio.  \n  \n C. Measurement of the damping time  \n By changing the trigger timing of the $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray CCD camera from the beam-injection timing, a beam-profile measurement during radiation damping could be carried out.  \n Furthermore, the improved time resolution by the newly installed fast mechanical shutter allowed us to measure the damping time. We then precisely measured the damping time with/without damping wigglers by using FZP monitor for the study of the damping wigglers.  \n Figure 19 shows the measurements of the damping time with/without the damping wigglers. Damping phenomena were clearly observed in the vertical direction. In order to evaluate the vertical damping time, we use the following function [24], described as  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { y } = \\sqrt { \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { i n j } } ^ { 2 } e ^ { - 2 t / \\tau _ { y } } + \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { r i n g } } ^ { 2 } ( 1 - e ^ { - 2 t / \\tau _ { y } } ) } ,\n$$ \n where $t$ is the elapsed time from injection timing. The injection beam size $( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { i n j } } )$ , the beam size after complete damping $( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { r i n g } } )$ , and vertical damping time $( \\tau _ { y } )$ are used as free parameters for fitting. By fitting this function to the vertical beam-size measurement in Fig. 19, we obtained that the vertical damping time $( \\tau _ { y } )$ without damping wigglers was $( 3 0 . 9 \\pm 0 . 6 ) \\$ ms and with damping wigglers $( 2 0 . 7 \\pm 0 . 8 )$ ms. A clear difference in the measured damping time between with and without damping wigglers was observed. The design values of the damping time with/ without damping wigglers are 21.1 and $2 8 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m s }$ , respectively. These values agree well with the damping-time measurements.  \n  \n D. Coupling dependence of the measured beam profiles  \n The coupling dependences were measured by changing the currents of the skew-quadrupole coils wound on two kinds of sextupole magnets. Figure 20 shows the typical beam profiles when a skew correction was carefully carried out [Fig. 20(a)] and all of the skew-quadrupole coils were turned off on purpose [Fig. 20(b)]. As shown in Fig. 20, we found that the vertical beam size increased and the measured beam profile was tilted when a skew correction was not applied. In order to measure the coupling dependence precisely, we measured the two sets of beam profiles at the same beam current when a skew correction was applied (hereafter called ‘‘skew on’’ condition), and the skewquadrupole coils were turned off (called ‘‘skew off’’ condition). Figure 21 shows all of the results of the two conditions of skew on and skew off. As shown in Fig. 21, the vertical beam sizes increased for all of the stored currents under the skew off condition compared with those under the skew on condition, while the horizontal one decreased. In order to estimate the coupling ratio, we also plot the calculation data including intrabeam scattering effect in Figs. 21(a) and 21(b). The data set of the skew on (skew off) condition agree with the calculation assuming the $0 . 5 \\%$ $( 3 . 0 \\% )$ coupling ratio. The absolute values of the measured tilt angles of the skew off condition are $( 6 \\pm$ 2) degrees, which is much larger than that of skew on condition of $( 0 . 7 \\pm 0 . 3 ) \\$ degrees.  \n  \n V. CONCLUSION  \n In this paper, we have presented an improvement of the FZP monitor and measurement results of the ultralow emittance beam in the ATF damping ring under various conditions. First, by thermally disconnecting the Si crystal from the stepping motor, the position drift of the obtained image was drastically reduced by a factor of 100, and fully stabilized within a few $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for one day. Second, we modified the FZP folder for a more precise beam-based alignment using $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray SR. This avoids the effects of aberrations due to any misalignments of the FZPs. Third, the newly installed fast mechanical shutter allowed us to measure a beam image within $1 \\mathrm { m s }$ . In addition, the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray CCD was synchronized with the beam-injection timing. We could measure the beam profile under the fully damped condition in the normal operation mode. At last, installation of the $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { x } }$ -ray pinhole mask system greatly reduced the background of x rays passing through the MZP.  \n With the improved system, beam-profile measurements were performed on three days. By using a fast mechanical shutter, we could remove the effect of an unknown $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ oscillation, which enlarged the measured vertical beam size, for the beam-profile measurement. We therefore could perform precise beam-profile measurements with a 1 ms shutter opening time. After carefully applying the skew correction, the measured horizontal beam sizes were about $5 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , and the vertical beam sizes were about 6 $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ at above $3 \\ \\mathrm { m A }$ stored current in the single-bunch mode, which corresponded to about $1 1 \\ \\mathrm { p m }$ rad of the vertical emittance. The measured beam sizes were in a good agreement with a calculation assuming coupling ratios of $( 0 . 5 \\pm$ $0 . 1 ) \\%$ . In addition, the measured energy spread also agreed well with the calculation. Thanks to the improved x-ray CCD and shorter time resolution of the newly installed fast mechanical shutter, we could also precisely measure the damping time of the ATF damping ring when the damping wigglers were turned on and off. The measurement results of the vertical damping ring agreed well with the design values. Furthermore, the coupling dependence of the beam profiles was obtained. Not only the horizontal and vertical beam sizes, but also the beam tilt angles, were measured precisely under the two coupling conditions. From these measurements, good performance of the improved monitor was confirmed.  \n  \n Finally, we note that the improved FZP monitor is now routinely used and helps to produce and manipulate the ultralow emittance beam of the ATF damping ring during beam operation.  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n First of all, we would like to express our gratitude to all members of the KEK-ATF group for their helpful support.

INTRODUCTION  \n X-ray free electron lasers are becoming an indispensable tool to study molecular interactions on a femtosecond time scale [1,2]. To generate the X-rays, ultrarelativistic electron beams are compressed and sent through a magnetic undulator [3]. The transverse size and shape of ultrabright electron beams are of great interest, hence transverse profile imagers that measure the particle distribution are key components of a free electron laser facility. A measurement of the electron profile is of particular interest for the determination of the beam area in transverse phase space, i.e., the transverse emittance. This parameter has a direct influence on the output power of a free electron laser. It also influences the gain length, which determines whether saturation of the FEL radiation can be achieved within the undulator length. Recent developments toward the highest brilliance X-rays and toward sub-femtosecond pulse length are leading to more stringent requirements on this instrumentation. Besides the increased demands on resolution, a new effect has been observed in recent years: highly compressed electron beams emit coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) at visible wavelengths [4–9], which impairs the measurement of profiles if it enters the imaging system.  \n Inorganic scintillators, which have been used in transverse beam profile measurements, help avoid this COTR [10,11].  \n An additional benefit is that the emission of the scintillation light does not depend on the longitudinal structure of the bunches.  \n We present here a novel oblique imaging geometry, which fulfills three goals simultaneously for the first time: (i) The scintillator plane is imaged to the detector observing the Scheimpflug condition [12]; (ii) A scintillating crystal of finite thickness is imaged observing the Snell-Descartes law of refraction [13]; (iii) Coherent optical transition radiation is directed away from the camera axis. The first condition has been observed previously in an accelerator environment, both for imaging of scintillators [14] and optical transition radiation [15,16]. In the present implementation, the geometry is modified as explained in Sec. II. As a result, the monitor directs transition radiation away from the imaging system, yet allows for a high-resolution imaging of beams smaller than the thickness of the scintillating crystal. A transverse profile imager complying with these principles has been built and tested at the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility [17]. We report the time-resolved measurement of electron beam slice emittances of electron bunches with a total charge of only 30 femtocoulombs using a transverse deflecting mode rf cavity with one of these imaging stations.  \n An experimental verification of the COTR suppression is ongoing. First tests have been performed at LCLS [18], which hint at a suppression that is several orders of magnitude better than in standard LCLS monitors [16]. The presently installed monitor suffers from coherent diffraction radiation from the chamfer of the mirror, and further experiments and a comparison to wire scanner measurements are required to quantify the COTR suppression and the suitability for beam profile measurements.  \n II. IMAGING OF SCINTILLATING CRYSTALS  \n A. Observation geometries  \n Profile monitors for the ionizing radiation typically consist of a scintillating crystal that can be inserted to intercept the primary beam inside a vacuum chamber, generating light that is imaged onto an image sensor. Excitation of the dopant levels in the scintillating crystal leads to an isotropic emission of light around the beam path in the medium. While different in their nature and in their applications, the effect of high-energy electron and photon beams on a scintillating crystal is very similar. As a consequence, most of the statements made in this paper are valid for both types of ionizing radiation, and differences will be explicitly stated. Figure 1 shows some commonly used layouts to image the fluorescent light onto the detector.  \n Each layout has specific limitations for the applicability at upcoming X-ray free electron lasers: Layout (a) may lead to radiation damage in the detector and is difficult to implement in an ultrahigh vacuum system. In layouts (b) [19,20], (c) [11,21], and (d) [22] the horizontal resolution is limited to the scintillator thickness because points along the primary beam axis are imaged to different locations on the detector. The field of view is limited by the depth of field of the optical system. Both issues are exacerbated for magnifying optics. Application of the Scheimpflug principle [12,23], shown in layout (d), improves the field of view, but the limitation due to the finite scintillator thickness remains. Layouts (e) [24] and (f) [25] can be set up to generate excellent resolution, smaller than the thickness of the scintillating crystal. However, the mirror intercepts the primary beam, which may lead to a gradual loss of reflectivity due to radiation damage, and the scattered particles may pose radiation protection issues.  \n Optical transition radiation, generated by charged particle beams at vacuum-scintillator and vacuum-mirror interfaces, is emitted toward the camera in layouts (a), (b), (d), and (e). The distribution of a microbunched beam that emits fully coherent radiation may be determined from phase retrieval of the far-field radiation [26]. However, for a partially coherent emission of radiation with random transverse spatial locations of the intense COTR, the measurement of beam profiles with incoherent OTR is problematic at best [27]. The intense coherent light can be suppressed temporally by gating the exposure of the camera to start after the emission of the prompt transition radiation, and to integrate only the delayed scintillation light [28]. This method requires a shutter which opens on a nanosecond time scale, and which effectively suppresses the coherent radiation which may be several orders of magnitude more intense. To the authors’ knowledge, this is currently only possible with intensified cameras that use microchannel plates, which add a significant layer of complexity, and which have limited lifetime [29].  \n  \n A geometric suppression, as proposed in the present layout, is independent of the camera readout, and would thus not be impaired by beam repetition rates that are higher than the camera frame rate, such as in superconducting accelerators like the European XFEL [30] and LCLS-II [31].  \n B. Choosing an observation angle according to the Snell-Descartes law of refraction  \n A beam of ionizing radiation generates a scintillating column along its axis through the entire depth of the crystal. The breadth of this scintillating column depends on the properties of the scintillator. Screens made from powdered scintillators show significant broadening due to light scattering within the screen volume [32]. Scintillating crystals are compared in [33].  \n It is assumed here that the primary beam passes the crystal undeflected, an assumption that is well fulfilled for high energy beams used in X-ray free electron lasers, and that the emission of fluorescent light is isotropic. A beam with zero transverse size generates a scintillating column with a length given by the thickness $d$ of the scintillator and the angle of incidence $\\alpha$ . This column is imaged onto a single point on the detector only for two observation angles, dictated by the Snell-Descartes Law of refraction [13], shown in Fig. 2(a). We assume an index of refraction $n$ in the crystal, surrounded by vacuum. If one chooses an observation angle $\\beta$ such that $\\sin \\alpha = n \\sin \\beta$ then the scintillating light emanating from the primary beam axis is imaged onto the same point, assuming that the depth of field of the imaging system is larger than the crystal thickness [34].  \n  \n C. Imaging at arbitrary observation angles  \n We will now look at the expected resolution when choosing an arbitrary observation angle. Figure 2(b) shows the imaging geometry for this case. Here, the primary beam enters a scintillating crystal of thickness $d$ at an angle $\\alpha$ to the normal. The primary beam produces a uniformly radiating slab of length $d / \\cos \\alpha$ , which is observed at a distance much larger than $d$ , under an angle $\\beta$ to the normal. Because of refraction on the surface of the crystal, the observer sees a virtual image of this slab, shown by a dashed line in Fig. 2(b).  \n We now look at the observation geometry in detail. Initially, we consider only the chief rays to an observer located at infinity, i.e., the observation with parallel rays. From the Snell-Descartes law of refraction [13], we get  \n $$\n{ \\frac { \\sin \\beta } { n } } = \\sin \\beta ^ { \\prime } .\n$$ \n Furthermore, the length of $\\ell : = \\overline { { A B } }$ can be calculated as:  \n $$\n\\ell : = \\overline { { A B } } = \\frac { d } { \\cos \\beta ^ { \\prime } }\n$$ \n and the length of $s ^ { \\prime } : = { \\overline { { B C } } }$ is  \n $$\ns ^ { \\prime } : = \\overline { { B C } } = \\frac { s } { \\cos \\beta } .\n$$ \n The cosine theorem of the triangle $A B C$ yields to:  \n $$\ns ^ { \\prime 2 } = \\ell ^ { 2 } + \\left( { \\frac { d } { \\cos \\alpha } } \\right) ^ { 2 } - 2 \\ell { \\frac { d } { \\cos \\alpha } } \\mathrm { c o s } ( \\alpha + \\beta ^ { \\prime } ) .\n$$ \n From all of the above, the transverse size $s$ of this virtual image can be derived:  \n $$\ns = d \\cos { \\beta } \\cdot { \\sqrt { \\frac { 1 } { 1 - { \\frac { \\sin ^ { 2 } \\beta } { n ^ { 2 } } } } + { \\frac { 1 } { \\cos ^ { 2 } \\alpha } } - 2 { \\frac { \\cos \\left[ \\arcsin ( { \\frac { \\sin \\beta } { n } } ) + \\alpha \\right] } { \\sqrt { 1 - { \\frac { \\sin ^ { 2 } \\beta } { n ^ { 2 } } } } \\cos \\alpha } } } } .\n$$ \n This apparent size is zero $\\overset { \\cdot } { s } = 0 \\overset { \\cdot } { \\underset { \\cdot } { \\longrightarrow } }$ ) exactly when:  \n $$\n\\beta _ { \\mathrm { i d e a l } } = - \\arcsin ( n \\sin \\alpha ) .\n$$ \n We thus recognize the Snell-Descartes law of refraction, the ideal observation angle shown in Fig. 2(a).  \n This result can be generalized to an observer located at a finite distance, imaging the object with a finite entrance pupil. The refraction at the surface of the crystal makes the virtual image appear closer to the observer, as shown in Fig. 2(b). The ideal focusing point of the camera has to be shifted by a fraction of the scintillator thickness. If we assume that the diameter of the entrance pupil of the lens is much larger than the field of view, the observation angle is the same for the entire extent of the beam, and the apparent size is not changed.  \n  \n D. Simulation with ray tracing  \n These findings are confirmed by a ray tracing simulation of the imaging geometry, similarly to the work presented in [28,33,35]. For the present situation, the imaging of a YAG scintillator was modeled using Zemax OpticStudio [36]. The following parameters were modeled: a primary beam with zero transverse size is intercepted by a scintillating crystal, which has a thickness of $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ and a refractive index of 1.8632 at a wavelength of $5 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . The primary beam has an incidence angle of $8 . 1 ^ { \\circ }$ to the scintillator normal, and the emission is simulated by five field points at depths of 0; 25; 50; 75; 100 $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ along the beam. This light is imaged with a perfect lens of $f = 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and an aperture of $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , corresponding to $f / 4$ . The lens is located at a distance of $4 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ to the scintillator, such that the magnification is $M = - 1$ . For this magnification, the effective $F$ -number of the lens is 8, and the corresponding numerical aperture is $N A = 0 . 0 6 2 5$ . The simulation is performed at various observation angles $\\beta$ .  \n The simulated spot size consists of three components: (i) the shift between the first and the last point at 0 and $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ depth, respectively, (ii) the defocus due to the depth of field, and (iii) the diffraction at the lens aperture, which can be calculated as $d = \\lambda / 2 \\sin \\vartheta$ with a halfopening angle ϑ.  \n The first contribution depends on the observation angle, and agrees with the analytical expression (1), as shown in Fig. 3. It is smallest for an observation angle of $1 5 ^ { \\circ }$ , as predicted by Eq. (2). For this situation, the defocus amounts to $3 . 6 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , and the diffraction limit of the lens results in an Airy disk of $5 . 3 8 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ radius. A real lens would add additional aberrations as compared to an ideal lens. Measurements of the point spread function (PSF) show an overall resolution of $8 \\mu \\mathrm m$ rms [18].  \n  \n E. Experimental verification of angle dependency  \n The angular dependency of the imaged spot size was verified experimentally. Scintillation light was generated by $3 \\mathrm { e V }$ photons from a diode laser $\\lambda = 4 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ ), focused to a spot of $w _ { 0 } = 4 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ FWHM into a $5 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ thick ${ \\mathrm { C e : Y A G } }$ scintillator. The Rayleigh length is $L _ { R } = \\pi w _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } / \\lambda = 1 6 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ , thus the beam diameter can be considered uniform within the crystal. The green scintillation light was imaged onto a CCD detector with magnification $M = - 1$ , excluding the exciting light with a longpass filter. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the projected beam profiles is shown in Fig. 4. for an angle $\\alpha = 2 4 ^ { \\circ }$ of the scintillating column.  \n F. Possible observation geometries  \n For $\\alpha = 0$ , the ideal observation angle is $\\beta = 0$ , corresponding to the rectilinear observation geometry (e) in Fig. 1. This layout is used for the low-energy screens in the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility. Beamlets of a size of $1 4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ rms have been measured with $2 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick scintillating crystals [37].  \n Choosing an oblique angle $\\alpha \\neq 0$ however offers unique opportunities for electron and X-ray beams, respectively: (i) For electron beams, the effect of camera saturation through coherent optical transition radiation emitted from the scintillator surface may be avoided by directing the radiation away from the optics. (ii) For X-ray beams above about $5 \\mathrm { k e V } ,$ , a semitransparent monitor may be built if one chooses a suitable low-Z scintillator such as diamond [21], because the radiation can be observed through an off-axis mirror.  \n The discussion up to this point allows selection of an ideal observation angle for arbitrary beam angles between zero and arcsin $( 1 / n )$ . There is, however, an additional constraint, which is based on the detector. The angle between the incident photons and the detector normal depends on the magnification $M$ of the lens, and is given by the Scheimpflug criterion arctanðtan $\\beta / M )$ . Most commercially available detectors employ microlens arrays to increase the efficacy of light collection onto the sensitive elements on the detector surface. This technology limits the acceptance angle of the detector to a cone of typically $1 5 ^ { \\circ }$ to $2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ around the detector normal. As a consequence, a larger observation angle limits the choice of detector to those that can be obtained without a microlens array.  \n III. TRANSVERSE PROFILE MONITOR  \n A. Construction of the monitor  \n A transverse profile imager built to observe the SnellDescartes law of refraction as well as the Scheimpflug imaging criterion has been installed at the end of the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility [17] at Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland. The SwissFEL Injector Test Facility was built to demonstrate the generation of electron beams suitable for the upcoming X-ray free electron laser SwissFEL [38]. The goal is to generate beams with a core slice emittance of $4 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ at a charge of $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ , and of $1 8 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ at a charge of $1 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ . The electrons are generated by a UV laser pulse in a radio frequency (rf) photocathode gun. The particle bunches are accelerated by rf cavities to an energy of up to $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { M e V }$ per particle.  \n Four scintillators are installed: a cerium doped yttrium aluminum garnet crystal (Ce:YAG) [39], a nitrogen doped synthetic diamond multicrystal [40], a mixed rare-earth silicate crystal “CRY019” [41], and a chromium-doped aluminum oxide ceramic “CHROMOX” [42]. The thickness of the scintillating crystals is $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ , and they are polished on both sides. A conductive layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) has been applied to avoid the collection of surface charge on the Ce:YAG and CRY019 crystals. The ceramic screen has a thickness of $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ .  \n The scintillators have a diameter of $2 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , but the field of view is horizontally constrained by the in-vacuum mirror [43] to $\\pm 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . This is sufficient for the present application. A variant of the screen monitor with a larger field of view has been built by using an observation angle of $3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ .  \n The screens are imaged by an $f = 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ macro lens [44] to a CMOS detector [45]. The magnification of the imaging system is 1∶1.22, resulting in an effective pixel size on the scintillator of $7 . 9 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n The scintillators are positioned at an angle of $8 . 1 ^ { \\circ }$ to the primary beam, and the in-vacuum mirror is placed such that the normal of the crystal has an angle of $1 5 ^ { \\circ }$ to the optical axis of the camera. The geometry is shown in Fig. 5. To fulfill the Scheimpflug imaging condition, the normal of the CMOS detector is tilted by $1 4 ^ { \\circ }$ to the optical axis. At this angle, the microlens array on the chip can be used with only minor loss in efficiency.  \n  \n The screens are mounted to an aluminum frame. They can be positioned into the beam by means of an ultrahigh vacuum translation stage. An in-vacuum mirror allowed the positioning of the camera at an observation angle of $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to the beam axis, which permitted the use of a compact vacuum chamber of $1 3 7 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ length. The field of view is $6 \\times 1 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ .  \n For reference measurements, optical transition radiation (OTR) was generated by charged beams on a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick silicon wafer [46]. The emission of OTR is a highly directional cone with an opening angle of $1 / \\gamma$ , centered around an axis opposite to the normal of the surface. In the present monitor, the silicon wafer was installed at an angle of $1 5 ^ { \\circ }$ to the beam axis. The transition radiation was reflected into the camera with an additional in-vacuum mirror, which has been positioned such that the imaging condition was the same as for the scintillator.  \n To increase the dynamic range of the profile imager, two neutral density filters [47] with $10 \\%$ and $1 \\%$ transmission, respectively, could be inserted into the optical path.  \n B. Measurements of resolution and slice emittance  \n The resolution of these scintillators was compared by focusing the electron beam horizontally onto each screen. The beam size was determined by fitting a Gaussian function to the projection of the image. Table I lists the values. For these measurements, the beam was not compressed, and as such no coherent optical transition radiation is expected. The resulting rms beam sizes can thus be compared to an OTR measurement.  \n Optical transition radiation is emitted in a cone around the beam axis, and the resolution that can be achieved with a perfect lens can be calculated analytically [48]. If the present $f = 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ lens were replaced by a perfect lens with the same aperture, we would expect a ringlike point spread function on the detector plane, with a radius of $3 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and a FWHM of $1 1 . 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The observed beam size is about a factor of five larger.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I. Measured beam image size on different scintillators, and compared to optical transition radiation.

[33], could not be confirmed in the present measurements, where image sizes of $1 \\sigma = 1 6 . 4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ have been observed. This could be mostly due to the thinner scintillator in the present experiment.  \n A transverse deflecting rf structure is installed after the accelerating structures, allowing the vertical streaking of the electron beam and thus converting the vertical spatial axis to a time axis on the screen. In conjunction with an electron beam optics consisting of adjustable quadrupole lenses and the transverse profile imager, measurements of the transverse phase space of the beam have been performed. This includes a measurement of the slice emittance of the beam, i.e., the time-resolved measurement of the transverse phase space volume. The measurement method is illustrated in Fig. 6.  \n Five quadrupole magnets are used to generate the electron beam optics required for the slice emittance measurement: (i) The horizontal phase-advance is regularly scanned to cover a total of about 150 degrees to precisely reconstruct the horizontal emittance. (ii) The vertical phase-advance between the transverse deflector and the profile monitor is fixed to about 90 degrees to optimize the longitudinal resolution of the transverse deflector: with a maximum deflecting voltage of $5 ~ \\mathrm { M V }$ and a $\\beta$ -function at the transverse deflector of $4 0 \\ \\mathrm { m }$ , the longitudinal resolution is about 13 fs (assuming a projected vertical emittance of $5 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ and a beam energy of $2 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { M e V } )$ ). (iii) The horizontal $\\beta$ -function is kept relatively high (between $3 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ and $4 0 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ ) to have beam sizes that can be conveniently measured even for very low emittances. Considering a beam size resolution of $1 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and assuming a beam energy of $2 5 0 \\mathrm { M e V } ,$ for a $\\beta$ -function of $3 5 \\mathrm { m }$ the emittance resolution is about $3 \\mathrm { n m }$ . (iv) The vertical $\\beta$ -function is kept below $1 0 \\mathrm { m }$ to control the beam size in the streaked direction.  \n  \n At each optics the phase of the transverse deflector is varied to obtain individual $y - t$ calibrations. The beam was split into slices using the centroid from a Gaussian fit as a reference, and the beam size was obtained for each slice. From the beam sizes at each optics the slice emittances along the bunch are obtained. The measurement and data analysis are described in more detail in [49].  \n Figure 7 shows two examples of a slice emittance measurement of a beam with a total charge of $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { f C }$ and $1 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ , respectively. The normalized slice emittance for the $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { f C }$ case is below $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . The error bars indicated in the plots correspond to the statistical uncertainties calculated from the statistical errors of the beam size measurements. The calibration error of the profile monitor is of the order of $1 \\%$ , which causes a systematic error of the reconstructed emittances of around $2 \\%$ . The calibration uncertainty is dominant over other systematic errors such as energy uncertainties or quadrupole field errors—the magnitude of these two error sources is around $0 . 1 . . . 0 . 2 \\%$ according to the accuracy of beam momentum and magnetic field measurements done at the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility. The optics of the beam core were well matched to avoid a systematic increase of the error of the reconstructed parameters due to optics mismatch.  \n  \n IV. CONCLUSION  \n A transverse profile imager to measure the twodimensional profile of ionizing electron or photon beams has been built. The observation geometry of the scintillating crystal observes the Snell-Descartes law of refraction and the Scheimpflug imaging principle and thus results in a resolution better than $1 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm m$ across a field of view of $6 \\times 1 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m } ^ { 2 }$ . This monitor was installed in the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility, and it has been used on a daily basis for measurements of beam profiles, projected and slice emittance. The resolution of the monitor is sufficient to measure a normalized slice emittance of $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ for a beam with a charge of $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { f C }$ .  \n Different scintillators have been compared, and for uncompressed electron bunches, the measured beam image sizes using Ce:YAG were found to be comparable to measurements using optical transition radiation.  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n The authors would like to express their sincere thanks to the many people at PSI who contributed to the design and construction of the profile monitor, including the mechanical engineering department, the vacuum and diagnostics sections.

        "text_data": "Boosting the Efficiency of Smith−Purcell Radiators Using Nanophotonic Inverse Design  \n Urs Haeusler,\\*,∥ Michael Seidling,\\*,∥ Peyman Yousefi, and Peter Hommelhoff\\*  \n Cite This: ACS Photonics 2022, 9, 664−671  \n ACCESS  \n 山 Metrics & More 国 Article Recommendations  \n  \n Supporting Information  \n ABSTRACT: The generation of radiation from free electrons passing a grating, known as Smith−Purcell radiation, finds various applications, including nondestructive beam diagnostics and tunable light sources, ranging from terahertz toward X-rays. So far, the gratings used for this purpose have been designed manually, based on human intuition and simple geometric shapes. Here we apply the computer-based technique of nanophotonic inverse design to build a $1 4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ Smith−Purcell radiator for subrelativistic $3 0 \\mathrm { \\ k e V }$ electrons. We demonstrate that the resulting silicon nanostructure radiates with a $3 \\times$ higher efficiency and $2 . 2 \\times$ higher overall power than previously used rectangular gratings. With better fabrication accuracy and for the same electron−structure distance, simulations suggest a superiority by a factor of 96 in peak efficiency. While increasing the efficiency is a key step needed for practical applications of free-electron radiators, inverse design also allows to shape the spectral and spatial emission in ways inaccessible with the human mind.  \n KEYWORDS: light−matter interaction, free-electron light sources, Smith−Purcell radiation, inverse design, nanophotonics  \n T ehle Smith−Purcell effect describes the emission of ctromagnetic radiation from a charged particle propagating freely near a periodic structure. The wavelength $\\lambda$ of the far-field radiation follows1  \n $$\n\\lambda = \\frac { a } { m } ( \\beta ^ { - 1 } - \\cos { \\theta } )\n$$ \n where $a$ is the periodicity of the structure, $\\beta = \\nu / c$ is the velocity of the particle, $\\theta$ is the angle of emission with respect to the particle propagation direction, and $m$ is the integer diffraction order.  \n The absence of a lower bound on the electron velocity in eq 1 makes Smith−Purcell radiation (SPR) an interesting candidate for an integrated, tunable free-electron light source in the low-energy regime.2−8 While the power efficiency of this process is still several orders of magnitude smaller than conventional light sources, it can be enhanced by super-radiant emission from coherent electrons.9 For this, prebunching of the electrons is a possible avenue ,10−13 but also self-bunching due to the interaction with the excited nearfield of the grating is observed above a certain current threshold.14−16 The use of coherent electrons is particularly interesting in combination with resonant structures, such as near bound states in the continuum.5,17  \n Even in the regime of incoherent electrons, Smith−Purcell radiation can be greatly enhanced by optimizing beam parameters (velocity and diameter) and grating properties (material and shape). The latter are generally limited by the chosen method of fabrication. Typical gratings for the generation of near-infrared, visible, or ultraviolet light are fabricated by reactive-ion etching or focused-ion-beam milling of silicon or fused silica.2−7,18 Coating the grating with a metal such as gold, silver, or aluminum can lead to plasmonic enhancement.19−22  \n  \n While a simple rectangular grating has been the most common choice in Smith−Purcell experiments, other designs have been investigated, such as metasurfaces and aperiodic structures.18,22−28 Here, we explored the optimization technique of nanophotonic inverse design29−33 to generate SPR much more efficiently. In contrast to other photonic designs created manually and optimized for a small set of parameters, inverse design finds an optimal design without any prior knowledge of its shape, purely based on the desired performance.  \n We applied the technique to maximize SPR from $3 0  { \\mathrm { \\ k e V } }$ electrons $\\zeta = 0 . 3 2 8 )$ passing through a silicon nanostructure and radiating around $\\lambda = 1 . 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in the transverse direction ( $\\cdot \\theta$ $= 9 0 ^ { \\circ } )$ ). The resulting nanostructure forms an asymmetric cavity around the electron beam, which leads to a highly concentrated emission into a well-defined direction. We compared the emission characteristics to those of a structure with a double row of pillars and a distributed Bragg reflector as well as that of a rectangular grating (Figure 1). Like most previously used gratings, these radiate broadbandly, both spectrally and spatially (Figure 1c). This impedes their application as a light source because part of the electron energy is converted to radiation that cannot be collected or is spectrally irrelevant. By contrast, the here presented inverse design can resolve these problems with unprecedented efficiency.  \n  \n DESIGN  \n The inverse design optimization was carried out via an opensource Python package34 based on a 2D frequency-domain (FD) simulation. At the center of the optimization process is the objective function $G$ , which formulates the desired performance of the design, defined by the design variable $\\phi$ (Methods). Here, we aimed for maximum radiation in negative $x$ -direction at the design angular frequency $\\omega$ corresponding to $\\lambda = 1 . 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (Figure 1). To this end, the Poynting vector S was numerically measured in the far field of the structure and integrated over one period $a$ , giving the objective function  \n  \n $$\nG ( \\phi ) = - \\int _ { 0 } ^ { a } \\mathrm { d } y \\ S _ { x } ( x _ { \\mathrm { f a r f i e l d } } , y )\n$$ \n The resulting design is depicted in Figure 1a and reveals two gratings on each side of the vacuum channel, which are similar in shape but $\\pi$ -phase shifted with respect to each other. The back of the double-sided grating results in a structure that resembles a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). This way, the radiation to the left is $4 6 9 \\times$ higher than to the right.  \n A 200-period-long version of the inverse-designed structure was fabricated by electron beam lithography $\\bar { ( } 1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { k V } )$ and cryogenic reactive-ion etching of $1 - 5 \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm { c m }$ phosphorus-doped silicon to a depth of $1 . 3 \\big ( 1 \\big ) \\mathsf { \\bar { \\mu } m }$ .35 The surrounding substrate was etched away to form a $5 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ high mesa (Figure 2a). We note that unlike in most previous works the etching direction is here perpendicular to the radiation emission, enabling the realization of complex 2D geometries.  \n The radiation generation experiment was performed inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an 11 nA beam of $3 0 \\mathrm { \\ k e V }$ electrons. The generated photons were collected with an objective (NA 0.58), guided out of the vacuum chamber via a $3 0 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ core multimode fiber and detected with a spectrometer (Figure 2b and Methods).  \n RESULTS  \n We compare the emission characteristics of the inversedesigned structure to two other designs: First, a rectangular 1D grating with groove width and depth of half the periodicity $a _ { \\mathrm { { ; } } }$ , similar to the one used in refs 6 and 36. And second, a dual pillar structure with two rows of pillars, $\\pi$ -phase shifted with respect to each other, and with a DBR on the back. This design was successfully used in dielectric laser acceleration, the inverse effect of SPR. $\\mathbf { \\lambda } ^ { 3 0 , 3 2 , 3 3 , 3 5 , 3 7 - } 3 9$ It further represents the manmade design closest to our result of a computer-based optimization.  \n Figure 2c shows the photon count rate as a function of the electron beam position. Maximum photon count rate is observed when focusing the beam into the channel of the inverse design structure at medium height. The spatial confinement in vertical direction points at the presence of a confined mode, as found in cavities. By contrast, Figure S1 reveals a nonresonating nature of the other two structures, with only slight dependence on the beam height.  \n The efficiency of a design is quantified by comparing three different figures of merit: the peak spectral radiation density $\\mathrm { { ( p W / n m ) } }$ , the total radiation $\\left( \\mathrm { p W } \\right)$ , and the quantum efficiency $( \\% )$ , defined as the number of photons generated per electron. All three quantities are determined in the experimentally accessible window, which is limited by the numerical aperture of the fiber. Its angular acceptance window acts as an effective spectral filter with a Gaussian shape centered around $1 4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ and a full width at half maximum of $1 7 5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ (Figure 3 and Methods).  \n The measurements in Figure 3a show overall a similar performance of the inverse-designed structure and the dual pillar structure. In terms of overall power, the inverse design is with $2 1 . 9 ~ \\mathrm { p W }$ around $12 \\%$ weaker than the dual pillars. This can be understood by the larger channel width of $2 6 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ compared to the $1 8 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ of the dual pillars (Figure 1a). By contrast, the rectangular grating is single sided, and the beam was steered as closely as possible to the grating to yield maximum radiation. Even then, the inverse design radiated 2.2(1)-times as strong as the rectangular grating. The superiority becomes even more pronounced when looking at the peak spectral radiation density. The inverse design reaches $0 . 1 6 \\mathrm { \\ p W / n m }$ at $1 3 8 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ , which is 3.0(1)-times as high as that of the rectangular grating. It also surpasses marginally the dual pillar peak efficiency. This is a first indicator for the narrowband emission of the inverse design, in contrast to the broadband emission of the other two designs (Figure 1c).  \n For a further study of the different structures, we performed 2D time-domain and 3D frequency-domain simulations. While both time and frequency domain are in principal legitimate ways to calculate the radiation spectrum from single electrons, they differ in computational complexity and precession. The time-domain simulation (Figure 3b and Videos S1, S2, and S3) can capture the instantaneous response to a structure of finite length. This is computationally expensive because the field of the entire grating needs to be calculated at each point in time. The frequency-domain simulation (Figure 3c), on the other hand, calculates the radiation density at each frequency of the spectrum. This is computationally less complex because it is sufficient to consider a single unit cell with periodic boundaries, which allowed us to perform 3D simulations. It can therefore take into account the limited height of the electron beam and the structure, which is on the order of the wavelength. This is particularly relevant here, because the inverse design yielded a double-sided grating that forms a resonator. The mirrors of the resonator are plane parallel and therefore do not form a stable resonator.  \n  \n Both the 2D time-domain and 3D frequency-domain simulations show similar results. For the inverse design, they predict a total radiation of 108(14) pW, a quantum efficiency of $1 . 1 ( 2 ) \\% ,$ and a peak spectral radiation density of 1.8(2) $\\mathrm { { \\ p W / n m } }$ . In terms of total power, this corresponds to an increase by $8 0 \\%$ compared to the dual pillar design and a colossal boost of $9 8 0 \\%$ with respect to the rectangular grating. The contrast in terms of peak efficiency within the experimentally accessible range from 1200 to $1 6 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ is even more drastic. It reaches an increase by $2 9 0 \\%$ compared to the dual pillars and $1 6 5 0 \\%$ relative to the rectangular grating.  \n DISCUSSION  \n Comparing the measured emission spectrum of the inverse design to its simulated profile shows that the observed emission was not as powerful and spectrally broader. We identify two causes: First, the electron beam current deteriorates as the beam diverges, where electrons hit the boundaries of the channel and are lost. By measuring the current after the structure, we determined an effective current $I _ { \\mathrm { e f f } }$ for each design (Figure 3e and Figure S2). The effective current is smallest for the dual pillar design, which has the narrowest channel, and largest for the single-sided rectangular grating.  \n Another factor that reduces the efficiency of the inversedesigned structure are the deviations of the fabricated structure from its design. Figure 4 shows that the structure was not perfectly vertically etched but has slightly conical features. This leads to a reduction of the quality factor of the inversedesigned structure, which is reflected in a less powerful $( - 6 7 \\% )$ and more broadband emission of radiation. By contrast, the efficiencies of the dual pillar structure and the rectangular grating are expected to be less affected by conical features due to their lack of pronounced resonance.  \n  \n Finally, we note that the inverse design was operated with the beam at the center of the $2 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ wide channel, whereas the rectangular grating worked at minimal beam-structure distance for maximal efficiency. The simulations assumed the distance $d = 7 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m } .$ , whereas Figure S3 suggests that the actual distance in the experiment was $5 8 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . Would the rectangular grating have been operated at $d = 1 3 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m } _ { \\cdot }$ , the simulations predict that the inverse design could improve peak spectral radiation density and overall radiation power by factors of 96 and 42, respectively.  \n It is interesting to relate the quantum efficiency of our inverse-designed structure to that of other silicon gratings reported elsewhere (Table 1). Roques-Carmes et al.6 state a quantum efficiency of $0 . 1 3 \\%$ in a similar experiment at $\\lambda =$ $1 4 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ . Although their interaction length was $1 3 \\times$ longer, and the distance to the grating was with $\\bar { d } = 2 3 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ just a fifth of ours, the inverse-designed structure surpasses it with its quantum efficiency of $0 . 2 \\dot { 2 } \\%$ .  \n A similar conclusion can be drawn in comparison to the simulations of a silicon grating at $\\lambda = 9 1 4 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ by Szczepkowicz et al.36 While the collection range in our experiment was $1 3 \\times$ broader, the here observed quantum efficiency was $7 8 \\times$ higher.  \n Comparing the experimental aspects, our approach of a double-sided grating poses higher demands on the beam quality than a single-sided grating. As such, the beam can only pass the grating if aligned parallel, and as shown, divergence limits the effective current for longer gratings. Moreover, our chosen method of fabrication restricts the grating region to the height of the structure and is predestined for in-plane collection. However, the collimated emission pattern achieved by our grating can simplify collection through fibers with small numerical aperture.  \n CONCLUSION  \n In summary, our work introduces the technique of inverse design to the field of Smith−Purcell radiators. We presented a silicon−photonic nanostructure radiating in the NIR regime for subrelativistic $3 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ electrons with a peak spectral density $3 \\times$ higher and overall power $2 . 2 \\times$ higher than a rectangular grating. With smaller fabrication inaccuracies and for the same beam-grating distance, simulations predict a 96-fold improvement in peak efficiency and $4 2 \\times$ higher total power.  \n The superiority lies first in our approach of using a doublesided grating in combination with a $\\scriptstyle \\mathrm { { D B R } , }$ an idea that was brought up in dielectric laser accelerators30,35,39 and became possible through recent advances in nanofabrication. Second, the inverse design algorithm suggests to use a closed scheme where the radiation is reflected at silicon boundaries. This leads to resonant enhancement and superradiance if used together with coherent electrons.9,11  \n Further improvement of the efficiency can be achieved by coating the dielectric grating with a metal, which has been reported to gain enhancement by a factor of 3 to 14 for rectangular gratings.6,36  \n The advantage of inverse-designed Smith−Purcell radiators goes beyond just higher efficiency. We presented a structure that radiates in a spatially and spectrally well-defined direction. More generally, the versatility of the optimization technique  \n Table: Caption: Table 1.

In the case of ref $\\begin{array} { r } { 6 , } \\end{array}$ the number of periods was stated as $( ^ { * } )$ , the effective number of periods based on the simulated interaction length, or $( ^ { * * } )$ , not explicitly stated. The collection ranges in the experiments were estimated as full widths at half maximum of the measured spectra. While the many different parameters jeopardize a direct comparison, it is clear that the inverse design structure of this work is far superior when it comes to the probably most relevant quantity: the (quantum) efficiency per period. The inverse-designed structure is at least a factor of 5 better.  \n allows to design the spectrum $( \\omega )$ , spatial distribution $\\mathbf { \\Pi } ( \\mathbf { r } )$ , and polarization (e) of radiation by favoring one kind $| \\mathbf { e } { \\cdot } \\mathbf { E } ( \\mathbf { r } , \\omega ) |$ and penalizing others, $- | \\mathbf { e } ^ { \\prime } { \\boldsymbol { \\cdot } } \\mathbf { E } ( \\mathbf { r } ^ { \\prime } , \\omega ^ { \\prime } ) |$ , with possibly orthogonal polarization $\\mathbf { e ^ { \\prime } }$ . Lifting the periodicity constraint opens the space to complex metasurfaces, which would for example enable designs for focusing or holograms.18,22−27,40  \n Future efforts could also target the electron dynamics to achieve (self-)bunching and, hence, coherent enhancement of radiation. In that case, the objective function would aim at the field inside the electron channel rather than the far-field emission. This would favor higher quality factors at the cost of lower out-coupling efficiencies. However, direct inclusion of the electron dynamics through an external multiphysics package proves challenging as our inverse design implementation requires differentiability of the objective function with respect to the design parameters. Instead, one may choose to use an analytical expression for the desired electron trajectory or an approximate form for the desired field pattern.  \n METHODS  \n Inverse Design. The inverse design optimization was carried out via an open-source Python package34 based on a 2D finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) simulation at the design angular frequency $\\omega$ corresponding to $\\lambda = 1 . 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The simulation cell used for this purpose is presented in Figure 5.  \n The design $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { r } } ( \\phi )$ was parametrized with the variable $\\phi ( \\mathbf { r } )$ . Sharp features $\\left( < 1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\ n m } \\right)$ in the design were avoided by convolving $\\phi ( \\mathbf { r } )$ with a 2D circular kernel of uniform weight. Afterward the convolved design $\\tilde { \\phi }$ was projected onto a sigmoid function of the form tanh $( \\gamma \\tilde { \\phi } )$ . This results in a closeto-binary design where the relative permittivity $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { { r } } } ( { \\bf { r } } )$ only takes the values of silicon $\\left( \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { r } } = 1 2 . 2 \\right) ^ { 4 \\mathrm { f } }$ or vacuum $\\left( \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { r } } \\ = \\ 1 \\right)$ ). We observed good results by starting the optimization with small values $\\gamma = 2 0$ and slowly increasing $\\gamma$ to 1000.  \n To improve the convergence of the algorithm, we enforced mirror symmetry in $x$ -direction onto the design. This reflects the symmetry of SPR under $\\theta = 9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ and reduces the parameter space by a factor of 2. Furthermore, we observed improved convergence when starting with a large grid spacing $\\left( 1 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m } \\right)$ , which is then slowly reduced to $3 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ as the optimization progresses.  \n 2D Simulations. The source term of our 2D simulations is given by the current density of a line charge with density $q =$ $- e / \\Delta z$ traversing the structure with velocity $\\nu$ along $\\hat { \\mathbf { y } }$ . The choice of the length $\\Delta z$ is crucial to obtain meaningful intensities from a 2D simulation.36 By choosing $\\Delta z = 1 \\mathrm { \\ ' } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ throughout, we obtained 2D results that were on average only $1 4 \\%$ off the 3D values. In the transverse direction, we assumed a Gaussian charge distribution of width $\\sigma _ { x } = 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ such that the spectral current density reads  \n $$\n{ \\bf J } ( { \\bf r } , \\omega ) = \\frac { q } { 2 \\pi } { ( 2 \\pi \\sigma _ { x } ^ { 2 } ) } ^ { - 1 / 2 } \\mathrm { e } ^ { - x ^ { 2 } / 2 \\sigma _ { x } ^ { 2 } } \\mathrm { e } ^ { - i k _ { y } y } \\widehat { { \\bf y } }\n$$ \n with $k _ { y } = \\omega / \\nu$ . Using this expression, the electromagnetic field was calculated via Maxwell’s equations for linear, nonmagnetic materials. As this is a 2D problem, the transverse-electric mode $E _ { z }$ decouples from the transverse-magnetic mode $H _ { z } ,$ where only the latter is relevant here. A typical 2D-FDFD simulation took 1 s on a common laptop, and the algorithm needed about 500 iterations to converge to a stable maximum.  \n Simulated Radiation Power. From the simulated electromagnetic field, we calculate the total energy $W$ radiated by a single electron per period $a$ of the grating. In the time domain, this would correspond to integrating the energy flux $\\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { s } } ( \\mathbf { \\boldsymbol { r } } , \\ t )$ through the area surrounding the grating over the time it takes for the particle to pass over one period of the grating. In the frequency domain, one needs to integrate $\\mathbf { \\Delta } \\mathbf { S } ( \\mathbf { r } , \\omega )$ through the area around one period over all positive frequencies, that is,36  \n $$\nW = \\int _ { S } \\mathrm { d } \\mathbf { A \\cdot } \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } \\mathrm { d } \\omega ~ \\mathbf { S } ( \\mathbf { r } , \\omega ) ,\n$$ \n $$\n{ \\bf S } ( { \\bf r } , \\omega ) = 4 { \\cdot } 2 \\pi \\mathrm { R e } \\left\\{ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } { \\bf E } ( { \\bf r } , \\omega \\omega ) \\times { \\bf H } ^ { * } ( { \\bf r } , \\omega \\omega ) \\right\\}\n$$ \n where we chose a surface $\\begin{array} { r } { \\int _ { \\mathrm { s } } \\mathrm { d } \\mathbf { A } \\ = \\ - a \\hat { \\mathbf { x } } \\int \\mathrm { d } z } \\end{array}$ parallel to the grating as we were only interested in the radiation in the negative $x$ -direction. For 2D simulations, the area $A = a { \\cdot } \\Delta z$ is determined by the assumed length $\\Delta z$ of the line charge density $q = - e / \\Delta z$ corresponding to one electron.  \n Numerical Instabilities. We observed that the optimization for a single frequency is very sensitive to numerical instabilities, which is why we optimized our design for multiple frequencies $\\omega _ { i } ( i = 1 , . . . , \\dot { N } )$ simultaneously. A suitable objective function could be the sum over all $G ( \\phi , \\dot { \\omega } _ { i } )$ , but we found that the min-function  \n $$\nf _ { \\mathrm { o b j } } ( \\phi ) = \\operatorname* { m i n } _ { i } G ( \\phi , \\omega _ { i } )\n$$ \n was even more robust against numerical instabilities. Our design was optimized for the three $\\omega$ ’s corresponding to $\\lambda _ { 1 - 3 } =$ 1350, 1400, and $1 4 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ .  \n Dual Pillar Design. The dual pillar design is inspired from ref 35. Pillar radii and DBR thicknesses were optimized using the same gradient-based algorithm as for inverse design. Pillars that are $\\pi$ -phase shifted with respect to each other are preferred over symmetric rows of pillars because they yield a stronger phase difference in $E _ { y }$ and therefore stronger coupling to the far field.  \n 3D Simulations. 3D finite-element-method (FEM) frequency-domain simulations were performed in COMSOL to analyze effects originating from the finite height of the structure and beam. The structures were assumed to be $1 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ high on a flat silicon substrate (Figure 1b). The spectral current density had a Gaussian beam profile of width $\\sigma = 2 0$ nm:  \n $$\n\\mathbf { J } ( \\mathbf { r } , \\omega ) = \\frac { - e } { 2 \\pi } \\big ( 2 \\pi \\sigma ^ { 2 } \\big ) ^ { - 1 } \\mathrm { e } ^ { - \\big ( x ^ { 2 } + z ^ { 2 } \\big ) / 2 \\sigma ^ { 2 } } \\mathrm { e } ^ { - i k _ { y } y } \\widehat { \\mathbf { y } }\n$$ \n Experimental Setup. The experiment was performed within an FEI/Philips XL30 SEM providing an $1 1 \\mathrm { \\ n A }$ electron beam with $3 0 \\mathrm { \\ k e V }$ mean electron energy. The structure was mounted to an electron optical bench with full translational and rotational control. The generated photons were collected with a microfocus objective Schäfter+Kirchhoff 5M-A4.0-00-STi with a numerical aperture of 0.58 and a working distance of $1 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . The objective can be moved relative to the structure with five piezoelectric motors for the three translation axes and the two rotation axes transverse to the collection direction. The front lens of the objective was shielded with a fine metal grid to avoid charging with secondary electrons in the SEM, which would otherwise deflect the electron beam, reducing its quality. The collected photons were focused with a collimator into a ${ 3 0 0 } { - } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ -core multimode fiber guiding the photons outside the SEM, where they were detected with a NIRQuest $^ { \\cdot + }$ spectrometer.  \n Collection Range. The measured Gaussian spectrum from Figure 3a can be explained by the limited numerical aperture of the collection fiber. Smith−Purcell radiation that is emitted in the nonperpendicular direction is offset from the optical axis for collection. This leads to a loss in collection efficiency, which we modeled with the function $\\exp \\{ - 2 r ^ { 2 } / ( { f } \\mathrm { { \\cdot } N A } ) ^ { 2 } \\} ,$ where $r$ is the offset measured at the collimator, $f = 1 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ is the focal length of the collimator, and NA is the numerical aperture of the fiber. We found good agreement with the experimental data for $\\mathrm { N A } = 0 . 1 1$ , which is below the 0.22 stated by the manufacturer and might have been a result of misalignment.  \n  \n ASSOCIATED CONTENT  \n $\\bullet$ Supporting Information  \n The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.1c01687.  \n Dependence of radiation on electron beam height within the structure; Determination of effective current; Dependence on beam-grating distance (PDF)   \n2D time-domain simulation of the inverse design structure (MP4)   \n2D time-domain simulation of the dual pillar structure with DBR (MP4)   \n2D time-domain simulation of the rectangular grating (MP4)  \n AUTHOR INFORMATION  \n Corresponding Authors  \n Urs Haeusler − Department Physik, Friedrich-AlexanderUniversität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen 91058, Germany; Present Address: Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, JJ Thomson Avenue, Cambridge CB3 0HE, U.K; $\\circledcirc$ orcid.org/0000-0002-6818-0576; Email: uph20@cam.ac.uk   \nMichael Seidling − Department Physik, Friedrich-AlexanderUniversität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen 91058, Germany; $\\circledcirc$ orcid.org/0000-0002-9261-9040; Email: michael.seidling@fau.de   \nPeter Hommelhoff − Department Physik, FriedrichAlexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen 91058, Germany; Email: peter.hommelhoff@fau.de  \n Author Peyman Yousefi − Department Physik, Friedrich-AlexanderUniversität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Erlangen 91058, Germany; Present Address: Fraunhofer-Institut für Keramische Technologien und Systeme IKTS, Ä ussere Nürnberger Strasse 62, Forchheim 91301, Germany.  \n Complete contact information is available at: https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.1c01687  \n Author Contributions  \n ∥ These authors contributed equally to this work.

We show that nonredundant masks are required due to phase fluctuations arising within the experimental set-up. We also show, using closure phase, that the phase fluctuations are factorizable into element-based errors. We employ multiple masks, including 2, 3, 5, and 6 hole configurations. We develop a process for self-calibration of the element-based amplitudes (square root of flux through the aperture), which corrects for non-uniform illumination over the mask, in order to derive visibility coherences and phases, from which the source size and shape can be derived. We explore the optimal procedures to obtain the most reliable results with the 5-hole mask, based on the temporal scatter in measured coherences and closure phases. We find that the closure phases are very stable, and close to zero (within $2 ^ { o }$ ). Through uv-modeling, we consider the noise properties of the experiment and conclude that our visibility measurements per frame are likely accurate to an rms scatter of $\\sim 1 \\%$ .  \n I. INTRODUCTION  \n We consider the measurement of the ALBA synchrotron electron beam size and shape using optical interferometry with aperture masks. Monitoring the emittance of the electron beam is important for optimal operation of the synchrotron light source, and potentially for future improved performance and real-time adjustments.  \n There are a number of methods to monitor the size of the electron beam, including: (i) LOCO, which is a guiding magnetic lattice analysis incorporating the beam position monitors, (ii) X-ray pinholes (Elleaume et al 1995), and (iii) Synchrotron Radiation Interferometry (SRI). Herein, we consider optical SRI, which can be done in real time without affecting the main beam. Previous measurements using SRI at ALBA have involved a two hole Young’s slit configuration, with rotation of the mask in subsequent measurements to determine the two dimensional size of the electron beam, assuming a Gaussian profile (Torino & Iriso 2016; Torino & Iriso 2015). Such a two hole experiment is standard in synchrotron light sources (Mitsuhasi 2012; Kube 2007), and has been implemented at large particle accelerators, including the LHC (Butti et al. 2022). Four hole square masks have been considered for instantaneous two dimensional size characaterization, but such a square mask has redundant spacings which can lead to decoherence, and require a correction for variation of illumination across the mask (Masaki & Takano 2003; Novokshonov et al. 2017; see Section VI). Non-redundant masks have been used in synchrotron X-ray interferometry, but only for linear (one dimensional grazing incidence) masks (Skopintsev et al. 2014).  \n In this report, we explore various configurations of a multi-hole, two-dimensional mask, emphasizing non-redundant masks, for an instantaneous measurement of the 2D electron beam size. Non-redundant masks have been used extensively in optical astronomical interferometric imaging to determine eg. the size of stellar photospheres, and or exoplanet searches (see Monnier 2003, Labeyrie 1996, Haniff et al. 1989), including recent observations with the perture mask on the JWST (Hinkley et al. 2022; Lau et al. 2023).  \n  \n The beam size measurements will be presented in a parallel paper (Nikolic et al. 2024). The purpose of this report is to review the experimental setup, and discuss the adopted standard processing of the data for this approach to synchrotron light source size measurements. We then present the details of why various processing decisions were made, based on the experimental data.  \n In general, the ALBA SRI facility is ideal to explore various aspects of interferometry, including the effects of redundancy, shape-orientation-size conservation for three apertures (Thyagarjan & Carilli 2022), and image plane self-calibration (Carilli, Nikolic, Thyagarjan 2023; Carilli et al. 2024).  \n II. BASICS OF INTERFEROMETRIC IMAGING AND NOMENCLATURE  \n The spatial coherence (or visibility), $V _ { a b } ( \\nu )$ , corresponds to the cross correlation of two quasi-monochromatic voltages of frequency $\\nu$ of the same polarization measured by two spatially distinct elements in the aperture plane of an interferometer. The visibility relates to the intensity distribution of an incoherent source, $I ( \\hat { \\mathbf { s } } , \\nu )$ , via a Fourier transform (van Cittert 1934, Zernike 1938, Born & Wolf 1999; Thomson, Moran, Swenson 2023):  \n $$\nV _ { a b } ( \\nu ) = \\int _ { \\mathrm { s o u r c e } } A _ { a b } ( \\hat { \\bf s } , \\nu ) I ( \\hat { \\bf s } , \\nu ) e ^ { - i 2 \\pi { \\bf u } _ { a b } \\cdot \\hat { \\bf s } } \\mathrm { d } \\Omega ,\n$$ \n where, $a$ and $b$ denote a pair of array elements (eg. holes in a mask), $\\hat { \\pmb s }$ denotes a unit vector in the direction of any location in the image, $A _ { a b } ( \\hat { \\mathbf { s } } , \\nu )$ is the spatial response (the ‘power pattern’) of each element (in the case of circular holes in the mask, the power pattern is the Airy disk), ${ \\mathbf { u } } _ { a b } = { \\mathbf { x } } _ { a b } ( \\nu / c )$ is referred to as the “baseline” vector which is the vector spacing $\\left( { \\bf x } _ { a b } \\right)$ between the element pair expressed in units of wavelength, and $\\mathrm { d } \\Omega$ is the differential solid angle element on the image (focal) plane.  \n In radio interferometry, the voltages at each element are measured by phase coherent receivers and amplifiers, and visibilities are generated through subsequent cross correlation of these voltages using digital multipliers (Thomson, Moran, Swenson 2023; Taylor, Carilli, Perley 1999). In the case of optical aperture masking, interferometry is performed by focusing the light that passes through the mask ( $=$ the aperture plane element array), using reimaging optics (effectively putting the mask in the far-field, or Fraunhofer diffraction), and generating an interferogram on a CCD detector at the focus. The visibilities can then be generated via a Fourier transform of these interferograms or by sinusoidal fitting in the image plane.  \n However, the measurements can be corrupted by distortions introduced by the propagation medium, or the relative illumination of the holes, or other effects in the optics, that can be described, in many instances, as a multiplicative element-based complex voltage gain factor, $G _ { a } ( \\nu )$ . Thus, the corrupted measurements are given by:  \n $$\nV _ { a b } ^ { \\prime } ( \\nu ) = G _ { a } ( \\nu ) V _ { a b } ( \\nu ) G _ { b } ^ { \\star } ( \\nu ) ,\n$$ \n where, $\\star$ denotes a complex conjugation.  \n The process of calibration determines these complex voltage gain factors. In general, calibration of interferometers can be done with one or more bright sources (‘calibrators’), whose visibilities are accurately known (Thomson, Moran, Swenson 2023). Equation (2) is then inverted to derive the complex voltage gains, $G _ { a } ( \\nu )$ (Schwab1980, Schwab1981, Readhead & Wilkinson 1978; Cornwell & Wilkinson 1981). If these gains are stable over the calibration cycle time, they can then be applied to the visibility measurements of the target source, to obtain the true source visibilities, and hence the source brightness distribution via a Fourier transform.  \n In the case of SRI at ALBA, we have employed self-calibration assuming a Gaussian shape for the synchrotron source, the details of which are presented in the parallel paper (Nikolic et al. 2024). Our process has considered only the gain amplitudes, corresponding to the square root of the flux through an aperture (recall, power $\\propto$ voltage2), dictated by the illumination pattern across the mask. We do not consider the visibility phases. Future work will consider full phase and amplitude self-calibration to constrain more complex source geometries.  \n Closure phase is a quantity defined early in the history of astronomical interferometry, as a measurement of the properties of the source brightness distribution that is robust to element-based phase corruptions (Jennison 1958). Closure phase is the sum of three visibility phases measured cyclically on three interferometer baseline vectors forming a closed triangle, i.e., closure phase is the argument of the bispectrum $=$ product of three complex visbilities in a closed triad of elements:  \n  \n $$\n\\phi _ { a b c } ( \\nu ) = \\phi _ { a b } ( \\nu ) + \\phi _ { b c } ( \\nu ) + \\phi _ { c a } ( \\nu ) .\n$$ \n In this summation, the element-based phase errors cancel, and the measured closure phase equals the true closure phase, independent of calibration. Closure phase is image shift invariant, and it relates to the symmetry properties of the source (Section IV D). Closure phase is conserved under element-based complex gain calibration.  \n Thyagarajan & Carilli (2022) present a geometric understanding of how closure phase manifests itself in the image plane. In essence, the shape, orientation, and size (SOS) of the triangle enclosed by the fringes of a three element interference pattern, are invariant to element-based phase errors, the only degree of freedom being an unknown translation of the grid pattern of triangles due to the element-based phase errors. A straight-forward means of visualizing how SOS conservation works is given in Figure 4 in Thyagarajan & Carilli (2022): for any three element interferometer, the only possible image corruption due to an element-based phase screen is a tilt of the aperture plane, leading to a shift in the image plane. No higher order decoherence or image blurring is possible, since three points always define a plane parallel to which the wavefronts are coherent. This is not true for an image made with four or more elements, since multiple phase-planes can occur for different triads, and higher order decoherence (ie. image blurring) occurs. SOS conservation then raises the possibility of an image-plane self-calibration process (IPSC; Carilli, Nikolic, Thyagarajan 2023). We consider IPSC in a separate report (Carilli et al. 2024).  \n III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  \n The Xanadu optical bench setup at the ALBA synchrotron light source was the same as that used in Torino & Iriso (2016), including aperture mask location, reimaging optics to achieve far-field equivalence, narrow band filters centered at 538 nm with a bandwidth of 10 nm, and CCD camera imaging. The distance from the mask to the target source, which is used to relate angular size measurements to physical size of the electron beam, was 15.05 m. The optical extraction mirror is located 7 mm above the radiation direction (orbital plane of the electrons), at a distance of 7 m from the electron beam, implying an off-axis angle of $0 . 0 5 7 ^ { o }$  \n We employ multiple aperture masks. Figure 1 shows the full mask on the optical bench, with the illumination pattern from the synchrotron. The full mask had 6 holes. Aperture masks of differing number of holes were generated by simply covering various holes for a given measurement. The geometry of the 6-hole mask is shown schematically in Figure 1. The mask was machined in the ALBA machine shop to a tolerance we estimate to be better than 0.1 mm in hole position and size, based on measurements of the fringe spacings in the intensity images, and coordinates of the u,v points in the visibility plane.  \n Note that the target source size is $\\leq 6 0 \\mu m$ , which at a distance of $\\mathrm { 1 5 . 0 5 m }$ implies an angular size of $\\leq 0 . 8 4 \\$ . For comparison, the angular interferometric fringe spacing of our longest baseline in the mask of $2 2 . 6 \\mathrm { m m }$ at $5 4 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ wavelength is 5”. This maximum baseline in the mask is dictated by the illumination pattern on the mask (Figure 1). Hence, for all of our measurements, the source is only marginally resolved, even on the longer baselines. However, the signal to noise is extremely high, with millions of photons in each measurement, thereby allowing size measurements on partially resolving baselines.  \n We consider masks with 2, 3, 5, and 6 holes. The 2-hole experiment employs a $1 6 \\mathrm { m m }$ hole separation, and the mask is rotated by $4 5 ^ { o }$ and $9 0 ^ { o }$ sequentially to obtain two dimensional information, as per Torino & Irison (2016). The 3-hole mask experiment employs apertures Ap0, Ap1, and Ap2. The 5-hole experiment used all of the apertures except Ap5 (see Figure 2).  \n In most cases, we employ non-redundant masks. A non-redundant aperture mask has a hole geometry such that each interferometric baseline, or separation between holes, is sampled uniquely in the Fourier domain (herein, called, the u,v plane), by a single pair of holes (Bucher & Haniff 1993; Labeyrie 1996). Non-redundant masks are extensively used in astronomical interferometric imaging, in situations where the interferometric phases may be corrupted by atmospheric turbulence, or other phenomena that may be idiosyncratic to a given aperture (often referred to as ’element based phase errors’). In such cases, redundant sampling of a u,v point by multiple baselines with different phase errors would lead to decoherence of the summed fringes in the image (focal) plane. Similarly, a full aperture (ie. no mask), which has very many redundant baselines, will show blurring of the image due to this ’seeing’ caused by phase structure across the aperture. Our 5-hole mask is an adaptation of Gonzales-Mejia (2011) non-redundant array, with the five holes selected to maximize the longer baselines, given the source is only marginally resolved.  \n  \n The full 6-hole mask includes a square for the four corner holes, leading to two redundant baselines (horizontal 16 mm 2-5 and 0-1; vertical 16 mm 1-5 and 0-2). These will be used for testing of the effects of redundant sampling in Section VI.  \n Masks were made with hole diameters of 3mm and 5mm, to investigate decoherence caused by possible phase fluctuations across a given hole. Observations were made with integration times (frame times) of 1 ms and 3 ms, to investigate decoherence by phase variations in time. Thirty frames are taken, each separated by 1 sec.  \n We estimate the pixel size in the CCD referenced to the source plane of 0.138 arcsec/pixel, using the known hole separations (baselines), and the measured fringe spacings, either in the image itself, or in the Fourier transformed u,v distribution.  \n  \n IV. STANDARD PROCESSING AND RESULTS  \n A. Images  \n Figure 3 shows two images made with the 3-hole mask, one with 3 mm holes and one with 5 mm holes. Any three hole image will show a characteristic regular grid diffraction pattern, modulated by the overall power pattern of the individual holes (Thyagarajan $\\&$ Carilli 2022). This power pattern envelope (the ’primary beam’ for the array elements), is set by the hole size and shape, which, for circular holes with uniform illumination, appears as an Airy disk. The diameter of the Airy disk is $\\propto \\lambda / D$ , where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength and $D$ is the diameter.  \n Also shown in Figure 3 are the Fourier transforms of the images (see Section IV B). The point here is that the size of the uv-samples decreases with increasing beam size = decreasing hole size. The primary beam power pattern (Airy disk) multiples the image-plane, which then corresponds to a convolution in the uv-plane. So a smaller hole has a larger primary beam and hence a smaller convolution kernel in the Fourier domain.  \n These images show the expected behaviour, with the diffraction pattern covering more of the CCD for the $3 \\mathrm { m m }$ hole image vs. the 5mm hole. Note that the total counts in the field is very large (millions of photons), and hence the Airy disk is visible beyond the first null, right to the edge of the field. This extent may be relevant for the closure phase analysis below.  \n Figure 4 shows the corresponding image for a 5-hole mask with 3 mm holes. The interference pattern is clearly more complex given the larger number of non-redundant baselines sampled $\\mathrm { \\Delta N _ { b a s e l i n e s } = ( N _ { h o l e s } * ( N _ { h o l e s } - 1 ) ) / 2 = 1 0 }$ for $\\mathrm { N } _ { \\mathrm { h o l e s } } = 5$ ).  \n B. Fourier Domain  \n Data are acquired as CCD two-dimensional arrays of size $1 2 9 6 \\times 9 6 6$ . We first remove the constant offset which is due to a combination of the bias and the dark current. We use a fixed estimate of this offset obtained by examination of the darkest areas of the CCD and the FFT of the image. We find a bias of 3.7 counts per pixel. Errors in this procedure accumulate in the central Fourier component, corresponding to the zero spacing, or total flux (u,v = 0,0), and contribute to the overall uncertainty of the beam reconstruction.  \n Next we pad and center the data so that the centre of the Airy disk-like envelope of the fringes is in the centre of a larger two-dimensional array of size $2 0 4 8 \\times 2 0 4 8$ . To find the correct pixel to center to we first smooth the image with a wide (50 pixel) Gaussian kernel, then select the pixel with highest signal value. The Gaussian filtering smooths the fringes creating an image corresponding approximately to the Airy disk. Without the filtering the peak pixel selected would be affected by the fringe position and the photon noise, rather than the envelope. Off-sets of the Airy disk from the image center lead to phase slopes across the u,v apertures.  \n To calculate the coherent power between the apertures, we make use of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem that the coherence and the image intensity are related by a Fourier transform. We therefore compute the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the padded CCD frame using the FFT algorithm. Amplitude and phase images of an example Fourier transform are shown in Figure 5. Distinct peaks can be seen in the FFT corresponding to each vector baseline defined by the aperture separations in the mask.  \n We extract the correlated power on each of the baselines by calculating the complex sum of pixels within a circular aperture of 7 pixels, centered at the calculated position of the baseline. With the padding used here 1 mm on the mask corresponds to 2.54 pixels in the Fourier transformed interferogram. An illustration of this procedure on the example frame is shown in Figure 18. We experimented with different u,v apertures (3,5,7,9 pixels), and found that 7 pixels provided the highest S/N while avoiding overlap with the neighboring u,v sample (Section V B).  \n The interferometric phases of the visibilities are derived by a vector average over the selected apertures in the uv-plane of the images of the Real and Imaginary part of the Fourier transform, using the standard relation: phase = arctan(Im/Re).  \n For reference, Figure 6 shows the intensity image and visibility amplitudes for a three hole mask with 3 mm holes and 1 ms integrations, Figure 7 shows the same for one of the 2-hole mask with 3 ms integrations, and Figure 8 shows the same for the 6-hole mask and 1 ms integrations. The u,v pixel locations of the Fourier components are dictated by the mask geometry (ie. the Fourier conjugate of the hole separations or ’baselines‘), and determined by the relative positions of the peaks of the sampled u,v points to the autocorrelation. These are set by the sampled baselines in the mask, the Fourier conjugate of which are the spatial frequencies. We find that the measured u,v data points are consistent with the mask machining to within $0 . 1 \\mathrm { m m } ,$ and that the u,v pixel locations for the common u,v sampled points between the 2-hole, 3-hole, and 5-hole mask agree to within 0.1 pixel.  \n  \n Notice that, for the 6-hole mask Figure 8, the u,v data points corresponding to the vertical and horizontal 16mm baseline have roughly twice the visibility amplitude as neighboring points (and relative to the 5-hole mask). This is because these are now redundantly sampled, meaning the 16mm horizontal baseline now includes photons from 0-1 and 2-5, and 16mm vertical baseline includes 0-2 and 1-5.  \n C. Self-calibration  \n The self-calibration and source size fitting is described in more detail in Nikolic et al. (2024). For completeness, we summarize the gain fitting procedure and equations herein, since it is relevant to the results presented below.  \n For computational and mathematical convenience (see Nikolic et al. 2024), the coherence is modelled as a twodimensional Gaussian function parametrised in terms of the overall width $( \\sigma )$ and the distortion in the ‘ $+ \\mathbf { \\nabla } ^ { \\prime } \\left( \\eta \\right)$ and ‘X’ $( \\rho )$ directions. Dispersion in e.g., the $u$ direction is $\\sigma / \\sqrt { 1 + \\eta }$ while in the $v$ direction it is $\\sigma / { \\sqrt { 1 - \\eta } }$ , which shows that values $\\eta$ or $\\rho$ close to $1$ indicate that one of the directions is poorly constrained.  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r } { \\gamma ( u , v ) = } & { { } } & { \\mathrm { e x p } [ - \\frac { ( u ^ { 2 } + v ^ { 2 } ) + 2 \\rho ( u v ) + \\eta ( u ^ { 2 } - v ^ { 2 } ) } { 2 \\sigma ^ { 2 } } ] } \\\\ { \\| V _ { i j } \\| = } & { { } } & { \\gamma ( u _ { i j } , v _ { i j } ) \\| G _ { i } \\| \\| G _ { j } \\| } \\\\ { \\| V _ { \\mathrm { a u t o } } \\| = } & { { } } & { \\displaystyle \\sum _ { i } \\| G _ { i } \\| ^ { 2 } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The fitting to the data is done using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The derived gains from the self-calibration rocess are shown in Figure 9, and listed in Table I.  \n The derived coherences, ie. visibility fractional amplitudes (relative to the zero spacing) corrected for the voltage gains, are show in Figure 10, for both 3-hole and 5-hole data, and listed in Table II. Gain fitting is not possible with 3-hole data since the problem becomes under-constrained, so the three hole coherences were derived assuming the 5-hole gains for illumination correction. The coherences are remarkably stable, to less than a percent. The 3-hole coherences are a few percent higher than the 5-hole data for matching baselines. This difference may relate to the assumed gains and possible different mask illumination for that particular experiment. Indeed, the fact that for one baseline on the 3-hole data some of the coherences are slightly larger than unity (which is unphysical), suggests the assumed gains may not be quite correct. A general point is that all the coherences are high, $\\geq 6 5 \\%$ , indicating that  \n the source is only margninally resolved spatially.  \n Columns 6 and 7 in Table II list the coherences derived after summing the 30 images taken over the 30 seconds of the time series before deriving the coherences. These data are plotted in Figure 11. If no centering at all is performed (column 6), the image wander and structural changes due to phase fluctuations across the field leads to decoherence up to $3 5 \\%$ . If image centering is performed based on the centering of the Airy disk before summing the images, the coherences increase, but remain lower than the average from each individual frame by 5% or so. Centering on the Airy disk, corresponds effectively to a ’tip-tilt’ correction, meaning correcting for a uniform phase gradient across the mask (the lowest order term in the phase screen). Decoherence is even seen when comparing 1 ms to $3 \\mathrm { m s }$ averaging (see Section V D).  \n Table I also lists the gains derived after image averaging, with and without Airy disk centering. In this case, the gains are essentially unchanged (within $1 \\%$ ), relative to the mean from the time series (row 1). This similarity for gain results from data that clearly involved decoherence of the visibilities themselves lends confidence that the derived illumination correction (the ’gains’), are correct.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I.

Visibility and Closure Phases  \n Figure 12 shows the measured visibility phases on three baselines (baseline 1-2, 2-3, 1-3; Figure 1) as a function of time. There is substantial variation between the frames, with a peak to peak variation of about $5 0 ^ { o }$ . Such a variation would lead to decoherence (smearing) of the source if either (i) no aperture mask were present and a direct image were made, or (ii) a redundant mask was used, for which Fourier samples using redundant spacings would have lower apparent coherence due to independent phase fluctuations.  \n  \n Another interesting feature is that the larger phase fluctuations appear to correlate in time between baselines 1-2 and 1-3. These are the two longer baselines, with similar geometry (see Figure 1). The correlation in time implies some spatial coherence of the phase screen across the full mask. In particular, a Kolmogorov turbulent power spectrum for phase fluctuations in the lab atmosphere (larger fluctuations on longer baselines), could lead to the measured correlation on the two long and similar baselines, although there may be other explanations, such as vibration of the optical elements (Torino & Iriso 2015).  \n Figure 12 also shows the ‘closure phase’ for this triad of baselines (Equ. 3). The closure phase is remarkably constant, with an RMS deviation of only $0 . 4 9 ^ { o }$ , and a mean value very close to zero. The stability of the closure phase in time, compared to the unstable visibility phases, implies that the phase fluctuations can be factored into aperture-based phase perturbations of the electromagnetic fields.  \n Figure 13 shows the closure phases for all ten triads in the uv-sampling, and the values are listed in Table III. All the closure phases are stable (RMS variations $\\leq 0 . 7 ^ { o }$ ), and all the values are close to zero, typically $\\leq 1 ^ { o }$ . The only triads with closure phases of about $2 ^ { o }$ involve the baseline 0-2. This is the vertical baseline of $1 6 \\mathrm { m m }$ length, and hence has a fringe that projects (lengthwise) in the horizontal direction. The origin of closures phases that appear to be very small, but statistically different from zero, is under investigation. For the present, we conclude the closure phases are $< 2 ^ { o }$ .  \n Closure phase is a measure of source symmetry. X-ray pin-hole measurements imply that the beam is Gaussian in shape to high accuracy (Elleaume et al. 1995). A closure phase close to zero is typically assumed to imply a source that is point-symmetric in the image plane (a closure phase $\\leq 2 ^ { o }$ implies brightness asymmetries $\\leq 1 \\%$ of the total flux, for a well resolved source), as would be the case for an elliptical Gaussian. However, the fact that the source is only marginally resolved (Section III), can also lead to small closure phases, regardless of source structure on scales much smaller than the resolution. A simple test using uv-data for a very complex source that is only marginally resolved, shows that for closed triads composed of baselines with coherences $\\ge 7 0 \\%$ , the closure phase is $< 2 ^ { o }$ . In this case, even small, but statistically non-zero, closure phases provide information on source structure.  \n Figure 13 also shows the closure phase for the 3-hole data, which has only one triad (holes 0-1-2). The 3-hole closure phase for triad 0-1-2 has a mean of $- 1 . 1 6 ^ { o }$ with an RMS of the time series of $0 . 2 7 ^ { o }$ . For comparison, the values for the 5-hole data for this triad were $- 2 . 1 7 ^ { o }$ and $0 . 5 9 ^ { o }$ . The values ought to be the same, all else being equal. The difference could arise from: (i) the source changed (unlikely), (ii) the geometry of the mask changed (could only be a rotation): but the uv-sampling points found by photom are within 0.1 pixels, (iii) the centering of the diffraction pattern on the CCD is different, which leads to a different sampling of the outer Airy disk. We are investigating these phenomena. For now, we can conclude is that $\\sim 2 ^ { o }$ is the limit to a reliable closure phase measurement from experiment to experiment, for the current data.  \n Table: Caption:  Body: <html><body><table><tr><td>Triad</td><td>Mean Closure Phase RMS degrees degrees</td></tr><tr><td>0-1-2</td><td>-2.17 0.59</td></tr><tr><td>0-1-3</td><td>-1.19 0.42</td></tr><tr><td>0-1-4</td><td>0.09 0.36</td></tr><tr><td>0-2-3</td><td>1.44 0.38</td></tr><tr><td>0-2-4</td><td>2.11 0.39</td></tr><tr><td>0-3-4</td><td>0.74 0.30</td></tr><tr><td>1-2-3</td><td>0.46 0.49</td></tr><tr><td>1-2-4</td><td>-0.15 0.68</td></tr><tr><td>1-3-4</td><td>-0.54 0.40</td></tr><tr><td>2-3-4</td><td>0.07 0.37</td></tr></table></body></html> \n  \n V. PROCESSING CHOICES  \n The analysis presented herein is meant as supporting material for other papers that present the science results. Our main focus is to justify the choices made in this new type of analysis of laboratory optical interferometric data.  \n A. Centering: phase slopes  \n For reference, Figure 14 shows the centers found with and without smoothing of the input image. Centering will affect mean phases and phase slopes across apertures. We have found that smoothing before centering, ie. centering on the Airy disk not the peak pixel, leads to the minimum phase slopes across the u,v sampled points, as seen in Figure 5. The scatter plot shows similar overall scatter with and without Airy disk centering, but there is a systematic shift, which leads to phase slopes across apertures.  \n Figure 15 shows a cut in the Y direction across the phase distribution for different centering. The phase slopes are clearly reduced with centering on the Airy disk.  \n Closure phase could be affected by centering of the image on the CCD – the outer parts of the Airy disk, beyond the first null are sampled differently. For reference, the counts beyond the first null without bias subtraction contribute about $4 0 \\%$ to $4 5 \\%$ to the total counts in the field with 3 mm holes and 1ms integations hole data.  \n Figure 16 shows the center pixel locations derived using Airy disk centering for the 3-hole and 5-hole data. The X values are the same. But the Y values differ by 5 pixels. The largest departures from zero closure phase for the 5-hole data all involve baseline 0-2, which is the $1 6 \\mathrm { m m }$ vertical baseline (X direction in edf file which implies a narrow fringe in Y direction). This baseline is also in the 3-hole data, and it is the baseline with fringe length oriented horizontally, which might lead to the largest deviation in the case of a change in north-south centering of the fringe pattern on the CCD.  \n Figure 17 shows the resulting phase image without any centering. The offset of the image center from the CCD field center leads to a complete phase wrap across the uv-apertures. This compares to Figure 5, where only small phase gradients are seen after centering.  \n B. U,V aperture radius: 3-9pix coherence and closure phases  \n We consider the radius of the size of the aperture in the u,v plane used to derive the amplitudes and phases of the visibilities. Figure 18 shows a cut throught the center of the amplitude distribution of the u,v image. The hatched area shows the 7-pixel radius. This radius goes down to the 6% point of the ’uv-beam’. Averaging beyond 9 pixels just adds noise, and beyond 10 pixel radius gets overlap between uv-measurements eg. 2-3 and 0-1.  \n We explore radii of 3, 5, 7, and 9 pixels, considering coherences and closure phases. Figure 19 shows the closure phases versus the u,v aperture radius. The closure phase values tend toward smaller values with increasing aperture size. The RMS scatter decreases substantially with aperture size until 7pix radius.  \n Figure 20 shows the coherences for different u,v aperture radii. The coherences vary slightly, typically less than $2 \\%$ . The RMS of the coherences are relatively flat, or slightly declining, to 7 pixel radius, with a few then increasing at 9 pixels.  \n C. 3 mm vs 5 mm coherences  \n We consider the affect of the size of the hole in the non-redundant mask on coherence and closure phase. Figure 21 shows the coherence for a 5-hole mask with $3 \\mathrm { m m }$ and 5 mm holes. The 5 mm data fall consistently below the equal coherence line, implying lower coherence by typically 5% to $1 0 \\%$ . Also shown is the RMS for the coherence time series. The RMS scatter for the 5 mm holes is higher, more than a factor two higher in some cases.  \n Lower coherence for larger holes may indicate phase gradients across holes. A hole phase gradient is like a pointing error which implies mismatched primary beams in the image plane and may lead to decoherence.  \n D. 3ms vs 1ms coherences: 5 hole data  \n We consider the affect of the integration time on coherence and closure phase on the 5-hole data (see Section VII for further analysis with other masks). Figure 22 shows the coherence at 3 ms vs 1 ms integrations. The 3 ms coherences are lower by about 2 - 10%. The rms of 3 ms coherences are much higher by factors 2 to 7.  \n The explanation of the Figure 22 is Figure 23, which shows the time series of coherences for 3 ms vs 1 ms. Two things occur: (i) the coherence goes down by up to 8%, and (ii) the rms goes way up with 3 ms, by up to a factor 7.  \n The increased rms in 3 ms data appears to be due to ’dropouts’, or records when the coherence drops by up to $2 0 \\%$ .  \n Figure 24 shows the closure phases for $3 \\mathrm { m s }$ averaging vs. 1 ms averaging. The differences in closure phases are small, within a fraction of a degree. The rms scatter is slightly larger for $3 \\mathrm { m s }$ , but again, not dramatically. Hence, closure phase seems to be more robust to averaging time, than coherence itself.  \n To check if some of the decoherence of 3 ms vs 1 ms data could be caused by changing gain solutions in the joint fitting process, in Figure 25 we show the illumination values for the 5-holes derived from 1 ms vs. 3 ms data from the source fitting procedure. The illumination is defined as $\\mathrm { G a i n ^ { 2 } }$ , which converts the voltage gain from the fitting procedure into photon counts (ie. power vs. voltage). We then divide the 3 ms counts by 3, for a comparison to 1ms data (ie. counts/millisecond). Figure 25 shows that the derived illuminations are the same to within 2%, at worst, which would not explain the 5% to $1 0 \\%$ larger coherences for 1!ms data.  \n In Section VII we consider the effect of averaging time on all the data, including 2-hole and 3-hole measurements.  \n E. Bias subtraction  \n We have calculated the off-source mean counts and rms for data using 2, 3, and 5-hole data, and for 1m˜ s to 3 ms averaging, and for 3 mm and 5 mm holes. The off-source mean ranged from 3.43 to 3.97 counts per pixel, with an rms scatter of 5 counts in all cases. We have adopted the mean value of 3.7 counts per pixel for the bias for all analyses. The bias appears to be independent of hole size, number of holes, and integration time, suggesting that the bias is  \n dominated by a phenomenon such as CCD read noise.  \n Figure 26 shows a plot of the mean coherences and rms of the coherences over the 30 record time series assuming no bias, and subtracting a bias of 3.7 counts per pixel. The coherences are systematically lower by about 2% with no bias subtracted, and the rms values are unchanged.  \n Figure 27 shows a plot of the closure phases over the 30 record time series assuming no bias, and subtracting a bias of 3.7 counts per pixel. The closure phases and scatter are effectively unchanged.  \n Overall, bias subtraction has a measurable, but not major, effect on the results of the interferometric measurements. Fortunately, the bias is directly measurable on the images, and hence we do not feel the bias is a significant source of uncertainty in our source size estimates.  \n VI. DECOHERENCE DUE TO REDUNDANCY  \n We demonstrate the decoherence caused by redundantly sampled visibilities using the 6-hole data. Recall that the 6-hole data has an outer square of holes, leading to two redundant baselines: the horizontal and vertical 16 mm baselines, corresponding to [0-1 + 2-5] and [0-2 + 1-5]. In the Fourier domain, these redundant baselines sample the same spatial frequency. With no phase fluctuations, these two fringes will add in phase and roughly double the visibility amplitude (modulo the gain factors). But if there is a phase difference between the two fringes, then fringe contrast, or visibility coherence, will be lower (see Figure 31).  \n The challenge is that one cannot independently determine the gain of hole 5 from the measurements, as was done for the five hole non-redundant data, since one cannot separate the gain factor and source size from the decoherence due to redundancy. As a start to the analysis, we investigate the time variability of the visibility amplitudes. We expect the variability of the redundantly sampled baselines should be higher than for non-redundant baselines given phase fluctuations and implied decoherence.  \n  \n Figure 28 shows the results for a few of the visibility baselines for the 6-hole data. Shown are the two redundantly sampled baselines ([0-1 + 2-5] and [0-2 + 1-5]), and two non-redundant baselines that are similar in length and orientation to these redundant baselines (2-4 and 1-3, respectively). Also shown are the two longest baselines (rising and falling diagonals 1-2 and 0-5; see Figure 2). We note that the visibility amplitudes for the non-redundant baselines in the 6-hole data are typically within $1 \\%$ of the same visibilities measured with the 5-hole mask.  \n A number of features are clear in Figure 28. First, the stability of the redundant baselines is much worse. The rms fluctuations with time are a factor 3 to 6 larger than for the non-redundant baselines. Second, the amplitudes of the non-redundant baselines that are similar in length and orientation to the redundant baselines are lower than for non-redundant baselines (red vs. blue and black vs. green; although better treatment of decoherence including the gains is given in Figure 29). Third, the time variations for the two redundant samples (black and red) are correlated. All these phenomena are consistent with decoherence of the redundantly sampled baselines due to aperture-based phase fluctuations.  \n To investigate decoherence caused by redundant sampling, we assume a gain for hole 5 equal to the mean between the gains of the two holes in close proximity to hole 5 (holes 3 and 4 see Figure 2 and Table I, mean gain of 3 and $4 =$ $\\mathrm { G } _ { 5 } = 9 . 2 5$ ). This gain assumes that the illumination pattern in that corner of the mask is relatively uniform. In this case, the decoherence becomes the ratio of the measured visibility amplitude (V6Hmeasured), to the sum of the expected visibility amplitudes of the redundant samples (ie. assuming no phase difference and decoherence). The expected amplitudes are given by: $\\mathrm { V _ { i , j } = \\gamma _ { i , j } G _ { i } G _ { j } }$ , where the gains were derived from the 5-hole non-redundant mask (Table I; and assuming $\\mathrm { G } _ { 5 } = 9 . 2 5$ ), and the coherence is also measured for the given baseline using the 5-hole non-redundant mask (see Table II). For example, for redundant sample [0-1 + 2-5], the decoherence is:  \n $$\n\\mathrm { D e c o h e r e n c e } = \\mathrm { V } _ { \\mathrm { 6 H m e a s u r e d } } / ( \\gamma _ { \\mathrm { 0 , 1 } } \\mathrm { G } _ { \\mathrm { 0 } } \\mathrm { G } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } + \\gamma _ { \\mathrm { 0 , 1 } } \\mathrm { G } _ { \\mathrm { 2 } } \\mathrm { G } _ { 5 } )\n$$ \n Figure 29 shows the decoherence time series for the two redundantly sampled visibilities. Again, the scatter is substantial, as seen in Figure 28. The mean and rms values for visibility $[ 0 \\mathrm { - 2 ~ + ~ } 1 \\mathrm { - 5 } ] = 0 . 9 3 1 \\pm 0 . 0 5 2$ , while those for [0-1 + 2-5] are $0 . 9 4 2 \\pm 0 . 0 4 7$ . Note that the maximum decoherence ratio reaches a value of unity, as expected for no phase decoherence, ie. when the two redundant visibilities are in-phase. This maximum of unity lends some confidence in the assumed gain for hole 5.  \n One curious result is the close correlation between the decoherence of the two redundant baselines with time, as can be seen in Figure 29 and Figure 28. Some correlation is expected, since the phase fluctations at hole 5 are common to both baselines. But we are surprised by the degree of correlation. Perhaps vibrations of optical components might be more susceptible to such close correlation as opposed to laboratory ’seeing’ ? Further experiments are required to understand the origin of visibility phase fluctuations in the SRI measurements.  \n We conclude that redundant sampling of the visibilities leads to decoherence at the level $\\sim 5 \\%$ , with a comparable magnitude for the scatter for the time series. A 5% decoherence is comparable to that seen comparing 1 ms vs. 3 ms time averaging of interferograms (Figure 22), and likewise the larger rms scatter of the time series is similar to that seen comparing 1 ms and 3 ms averaging. A 5% decoherence for a redundantly sampled baseline would be caused by a $\\sim 2 0 ^ { o }$ phase difference between the two redundant visibilities.  \n These results necessitate the use of a non-redundant mask to avoid decoherence caused by hole-based phase perturbations due to eg. turbulence in the lab atmosphere or vibration of optical components (Torino & Iriso 2015). Likewise, a filled-aperture imaging system will display image smearing due to these phase perturbations.  \n A curious result from the source size analysis (Nikolic et al. 2024), was that the electron beam size derived with from the 5-hole mask with 3 ms averaging data resulted in a larger derived beam size than the 5-hole 1 ms data. We initially assumed this was due to temporal decoherence of the 3 ms data. However, the rotating 2-hole technique, using 3 ms averaging, resulted in the correct beam size, although with larger scatter in the time series. We explore this apparent contradiction using the 3-hole data as a third comparator.  \n In Figure 30 we show the time series of the measured visibility amplitudes (in counts) on the 16 mm vertical baseline (0-2) for the following data: 5-hole 1 ms and 3 ms, 3-hole $1 \\mathrm { m s }$ and 3 ms, and the 2-hole 3 ms (recall, no 2-hole 1 ms data was taken). This is a busy plot, but the main points can be summarized as:  \n • The 3-hole 1ms and 5-hole 1ms visibility amplitudes (red and blue) agree nicely, with less than a percent difference in mean value of $1 8 0 \\pm 2$ , with no dropouts and low scatter.   \n• The 2-hole 3ms and 3-hole 3ms visibilities (green and purple) also have most points of similar amplitude as the 5-hole 1ms data, with a mean value of $\\sim 1 7 8 \\pm 8$ , but the rms scatter is larger than the 1 ms data by a factor four. This larger scatter is partially due to a few points appearing as ’dropouts’, with amplitudes up to $2 0 \\%$ lower than the rest.   \n• The outlier dataset is the 5-hole 3ms data (yellow). This data set also has dropouts (see also Figure 23), but further, all of the points appear low, with a mean value substantially lower than all the other data sets, and with the largest rms scatter: $1 6 8 \\pm 1 1$ .  \n Hence, comparing the 1ms data (5 and 3 holes), to the 3ms data (2 and 3 holes), it would appear that the primary effect of longer integration time is to increase the scatter, and cause a few substantial dropouts, which lowers the mean amplitude slightly. But most amplitudes are consistent between 1ms and 3ms frame times, leading to the consistency between the 2-hole 3ms source size calculation and the 5-hole 1ms result.  \n The 5-hole 3ms data is anomalous, in that it has the highest scatter, including dropouts, and a 7% lower overall mean. We speculate that the turbulence or other phase corrupting factors in the laboratory (eg. mirror vibrations), were different at the time of the 5-hole 3ms experiment. Further experiments are planned to explore this issue.  \n As a final pedagogic exercise, we ask: what happens when, for a given baseline, two fringes of equal amplitude but different phase ${ } = { }$ position on detector) are summed during a single measurement, as would occur, for instance, if during the frame integration time there is a phase perturbation leading to a rigid shift of the fringe. Figure 31 shows the profile through a vertical fringe from the 2-hole data, as well as the same profile after shifting the frame by $1 / 4$ of the fringe separation, then summing and scaling by a factor $1 / 2$ . The result is not a smearing or broadening of the fringe, nor a change in fringe spacing, but a change in the contrast, or the ratio of the maximum to minimum values. This behaviour is the basis for the historical definition of the fringe coherence, or visibility $= ( \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } - \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } ) / ( \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } + \\mathrm { I } _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } )$ (Michelson 1890; Monnier 2003).  \n VIII. ERROR ANALYSIS  \n A. Photon Noise Floor  \n We have tens of millions of CCD counts per image, and hence the errors from photon counting statistics are low. To obtain a rough estimate, we perform two calculations.  \n First, the number of photons contributing to a visibility is roughly the sum in the uv-aperture divided by the number of pixels in the uv-aperture (the finite size of the uv-aperture is due to a convolution in the uv-plane by the Fourier transform of the ’primary beam’, i.e. the Airy disk, and hence the uv-pixels are not independent). Typically, the visibility amplitudes integrated over the 7-pixel uv-aperture radius, are order $6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ , implying about $3 . 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ counts. The fractional error from photon counting is then $1 / \\mathrm { r o o t } ( 3 . 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 } ) = 0 . 1 6 \\%$ .  \n Second, we sum over similar 7-pixel radius apertures in regions of the uv-plane with no signal, and get a mean value of $\\sim 1 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ , which, relative to the typical visibility-aperture values of $6 \\times 1 0 ^ { 7 }$ implies an error of $\\sim 0 . 2 5 \\%$  \n B. Processing Errors: Gaussian Random Approximation  \n Beyond photon statistics, there are a number of processing steps that affect the resulting coherences, and hence the fit to the source size, including: uv-aperture size, bias subtraction, image centering, and others. In this section, we perform modeling of the uv-data to get an estimate of what level of errors in the coherences could lead to the measured scatter in the final results, assuming a Gaussian random distribution for the various errors over time. Systematic errors with time are considered below. While not strictly rigorous (the modeling does not include effects related to eg. the edges of the CCD or bias subtraction), this uv-model approach does provide a rough estimate of the summed level of error likely in the ALBA data, as well as how such errors may affect the final results.  \n Table: Caption:  Body: <html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Amplitude</td><td>Major Axis microns</td><td>microns</td><td>Minor Axis Position Angle degrees</td></tr><tr><td>Data Fit</td><td></td><td>59.6 ± 0.1</td><td>23.8 ± 0.5</td><td>15.9 ± 0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Model</td><td>357.70</td><td>60</td><td>24</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>1% errors</td><td>357.59±0.26</td><td>59.87 ± 0.11</td><td>23.77±0.22</td><td>15.83 ± 0.14</td></tr><tr><td>10% errors</td><td>359.79 ± 2.33</td><td>60.02 ± 1.01</td><td>27.71 ± 1.58</td><td>17.49 ± 1.61</td></tr></table></body></html> \n TABLE IV. Error analysis from modeling. The first row lists the measurements from Nikolic et al. (2024)  \n We start by creating a FITS image of a Gaussian model with the shape of the ALBA electron beam, for which we adopt a dispersion of $6 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\times 2 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , and major axis position angle $= + 1 6 ^ { o }$ CCW from the horizontal. This model image is converted into arcseconds using the distance between the mask and the synchrotron source (15.05 m). We also generate a configuration file corresponding to the 5-hole mask used in our experiments, with baselines and hole size scaled to get uv-coordinates in wavelengths. A uv-data measurement set is then generated from the model and the configuration using the CASA task ’SIMOBSERVE’, resulting in a 10 visibility measurement set with the proper uv-baseline distribution, primary beam size, and model visibilities (complex coherences).  \n Gaussian random noise is then added to the complex visibilities at the rms level of $\\sim 1 0 \\%$ of the visibility amplitudes, and a second test was done with $1 \\%$ rms noise. Since the noise is incorporated in the complex visibilities, it affects both phase and amplitude. In each case, a series of 30 measurement sets with independent noise (changing ’setseed’ parameter), are generated to imitate the 30 frames taken in our measured time series.  \n We employ ’UVMODELFIT’ in CASA to then fit for the source amplitude, major axis, minor axis, and major axis position angle. Starting guesses are given that are close to, but not identical with, the model parameters (within $2 0 \\%$ ), although the results are insensitive to the starting guesses (within reason).  \n We first run uvmodelfit on the data with no noise, and recover the expected model parameters to better than $1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ precision. These low level differences arise from numerical pixelization.  \n Figure 32 shows the results for the two simulation ’time series’, and Table IV lists the values for the mean and rms/root(30). Also listed are the results from the measurements in Nikolic et al. (2024), and the input model. Two results are of note.  \n First, the $1 \\%$ rms noise on the visibilities results in fitted quantities (amplitude, bmaj, bmin, pa), that are consistent with the model parameters, to within the scatter. Also, the rms scatter for the fit paramaters are of similar magnitude as those found for the real data.  \n Second, the $1 0 \\%$ rms visibility noise leads to $\\sim 1 0 \\times$ higher scatter in the fitting results. Moreover, the minor axis fitting shows a skewed distribution toward values higher than the input model (ie. 21 points above the model line, and 9 below). We suspect that this skewness arises due to a Poisson-like bias when fitting for a positive definite quantity, when the errors become significant compared to the value itself. This skewness is not seen in the $1 \\%$ error analysis.  \n C. Systematic Errors  \n We investigate the effect of systematic errors using real data for visibility amplitudes from the ALBA 5-hole data. Two simple tests are performed: adjust the amplitudes systematically low by 5%, and high by 5%, then run the Gaussian fitting routine in Nikolic et al. (2024).  \n The fitted source size for the 5% low amplitudes increases by $6 . 4 \\%$ , while the size decreases by 6.9% for the 5% high amplitudes. This is qualitatively consistent with the expected increase in source size for lower coherences, and vice versa. Quantitatively, for small offsets, the source size appears to be roughly linear with systematic offset for the visibility amplitudes. However, the fitting routine includes a joint fit for the gains of each hole. These gains also change slightly with systematic errors, with up to 2% lower gains for lower amplitudes, and similarly higher gains for higher amplitudes.  \n IX. SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS  \n A. Summary  \n We have described processing and Fourier analysis of multi-hole interferometric imaging at optical wavelengths at the ALBA synchrotron light source to derive the size and shape of the electron beam using non-redundant masks of 2, 3, and 5 holes, plus a 6-hole mask with some redundancy. The techniques employed parallel those used in astronomical interferometry, with the addition of gain amplitude self-calibration. Self-calibration is possible in the laboratory case due to the vastly higher number of photons available relative to the astronomical case. We have considered varying hole size and varying frame time. The main conclusions from this work are:  \n • The size of the Airy disk behaves as expected for changing hole sizes. There are many photons (millions), such that the diffraction pattern is sampled beyond the first null of the Airy disk, to the edge of the CCD field. • We develop a technique of self-calibration assuming a Gaussian model to simultaneously solve for the source size and the relative illumination of the mask (the hole-based voltage gains). The gains are stable to within $1 \\%$ over 30 seconds, and relative illumination of different holes can differ by up to $3 0 \\%$ in voltage solutions. Hence, gain corrections are required to derive visibility coherences, and hence the source size. • We show visibility phases have a peak-to-peak variation over 30 seconds of $\\sim 5 0 ^ { o }$ . Further, coherences for 3 ms frame-times for the 5-hole data are systematically lower than those for $1 \\mathrm { m s }$ frame time by up to $1 0 \\%$ , and the 3 ms coherences are much noisier than $1 \\mathrm { m s }$ . We also find the phase fluctuations are correlated on two longer and similar baselines.  \n • We find the closure phases are remarkably stable, with an RMS $\\sim 0 . 3 ^ { o }$ over 30 seconds, even though the visibility phases show large temporal variations. This implies that the visibility phase variations can be factorized into phase terms associated with the complex voltage response of each hole in the mask. • The closure phases are small, $\\leq 2 ^ { o }$ . For a well resolved source, small closure phases imply the source structure is symmetric to within $\\sim 1 \\%$ of the total flux from the source. However, for a marginally resolved source, small closure phases may still arise regardless of complex source structure on scales much less that the fringe spacing. • We demonstrate decoherence on redundantly sampled baselines using a 6-hole mask. The redundantly sampled baselines show decoherence at the level of $\\sim 5 \\%$ , and have a much larger scatter of the visibility amplitudes for the time series. The results are consistent with phase fluctuations affecting the coherence of redundantly sampled baselines. These fluctuations necessitate the use of non-redundant masks, as opposed to redundant masks or filled apertures, in order to properly measure the coherences and source size. • Comparing visibility amplitudes for the 0-2 baseline (16 mm vertical) 2-hole 3ms data with 3-hole 1ms and 3ms data, and with the 5-hole 1ms data, the primary effects of the longer integration are to induce ’dropouts’, where the coherence falls by 5% to $1 5 \\%$ for one 3ms frame, and to increase the overall rms scatter of the time series. The mean value of the amplitudes are consistent between the 1ms and 3ms 2-hole and 3-hole data, although the scatter is a factor 4 higher for the 3ms data. The one outlier data set is the 5-hole 3ms data, where dropouts are also seen, but the mean amplitude for the rest of the points is also lower by about $5 \\%$ , and the rms scatter is the largest by $4 0 \\%$ . • We estimate a noise floor for the visibilities based on photon statistics of order $0 . 2 \\%$ . However, there are a number of steps in the processing that could lead to larger errors. We perform an error analysis based on model visibilities and Gaussian fitting which suggests that the noise on our measured visibilities is of order $1 \\%$ . Investigation of larger errors shows a bias toward larger fitted minor axis values, likely due to a Poisson-type bias. We find the fitted source size is roughly linear with systematic offsets of the coherences, for small offsets.  \n In terms of processing, we find:  \n • Centering on the Airy disk of the measured images leads to the best results in the Fourier domain, meaning, the smallest phase slopes across the u,v aperture.   \n• A 7 pixel radius for the u,v aperture in deriving visibility amplitudes and phases is optimal for this setup.   \n• Comparing 3 mm holes vs. 5 mm holes, the smaller holes lead to higher coherences, and lower noise over the time series, as might be expected due to phase gradients across the holes.   \n• Likewise, 1 ms frame time results in much lower rms scatter in the visibility amplitudes and closure phases relative to 3 ms.   \n• We derive a bias in each frame of about 3.7 counts per pixel, and we subtract this bias before analysis. Not subtracting the bias leads to lower coherences by about $2 \\%$ .  \n B. Future Directions  \n Following are some recommendations on future experiments that might improve the capabilities of the technique.  \n • Higher physical resolution (in $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ in the source plane): physical resolution at the source (ie. the fringe spacing in units of length) $\\mathbf { \\lambda } = \\operatorname { L } \\times ( \\lambda / \\mathrm { B } )$ , where $\\mathrm { L }$ is the distance between the mask and the source, $\\lambda$ is the observing wavelength, and B is the baseline ( $\\lambda / \\mathrm { B }$ is the fringe spacing in radians). Higher physical resolution can be realized in three ways:  \n – Shorter wavelength (decrease $\\lambda$ ): change the filter to a shorter wavelength. The question then becomes one of performance of mirrors, lenses, and mirrors, and the source counts.   \n– Longer baselines on the mask (increase B): this is limited by the light beam foot-print on the mask (Figure 1), which is dictated by the pick-off optics and window in Xanadu. • Measure the aperture illumination, or gains, individually at the start of the experiment, to compare with the fitted gains.   \n• Shorter integration (frame exposure) times could be used to check the coherence.   \n• Vary the electron beam size in real time and verify the measurement method.   \n• Precision dark frames: Match the integration times of observing frames before and after.   \n• Rotate the mask to fill out the uv coverage.  \n  \n C. Beyond Gaussianity  \n Beyond the Gaussian assumption for synchrotron light sources, there is the broader issue of characterizing the shape of high energy electron beams used across industry and science, and the potential importance of non-Gaussian electron distributions. Examples include high energy electron beam applications in which the beam is shaped to conform to some specific application, such as medical usage to match beam shape to target size, or the recent technique of using transverse resonance island buckets in synchrotron light sources to provide multiple stable orbits winding around the main beam orbit (Goslawski et al. 2017).  \n A multi-hole, non-redundant mask and subsequent Fourier imaging analysis, including deconvolution of the point response function (Fourier transform of the u,v sampling), and self-calibration in both phase and amplitude, could be implemented to determine more complex electron beam distributions, without strict a priori model assumptions. The process could parallel the ‘hybrid mapping’ process employed in astronomical Very Long Baseline Interferometry, which includes self-calibration and some form of deconvolution (see Pearson & Readhead 1984). A requirement of such a process is the need for more measurements (visibilities) than degrees of freedom in the source. For example, a double Gaussian would have 10 degrees of freedom = position (2) and shape (3) of each Gaussian. We have generated a template for a 7-hole non-redundant mask based on the aperture mask used on the James Webb Space Telescope that fills the light footprint on the mask (Sivarmakarishnan et al. 2024). The full complex gain self-calibration of amplitudes and phases also represent a precise wavefront sensor, where the phases correspond to the photon pathlength through the optical system.  \n More generally, characterizing the shape of intense light sources other than synchrotron sources may be possible with this technique, such as in inertial fusion reactors, where the driving lasers need to be highly focused shaped, and the shape of plasma EUV light sources in photo-lithography.  \n Acknowledgments.

The device operates between the photon energies 4 and $1 3 \\mathrm { k e V }$ and uses diamond transmission gratings and bent Si crystals for spectral measurements on the first diffraction order of the beam. The device has an energy window of $0 . 7 \\%$ of the median photon energy of the free-electron laser pulses and a spectral resolution (full width at half-maximum) $\\Delta E / E$ on the order of $1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ . The device was characterized by comparing its performance with reference data from synchrotron sources, and a parametric study investigated other effects that could affect the reliability of the spectral information.  \n 1. Introduction  \n The pulse-to-pulse measurement of spectra of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) (Bergmann et al., 2017) is of fundamental importance for several experimental techniques ranging from resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) (Lemke et al., 2013; Chergui, 2016; Obara et al., 2017; Park et al., 2019; Kimberg & Rohringer, 2016; Błachucki et al., 2014; Kayser et al., 2019) to protein crystallography (Tono et al., 2015; Moreno-Chicano et al., 2019). The SASE process changes the spectral properties of the X-ray pulse on a pulse-to-pulse basis, which requires a device for online, non-invasive measurements of the X-ray spectra for both experimental spectral normalization and performance optimization (Rehanek et al., 2017). A good example of the use of an online spectrometer is in X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), where measurements have been reported using both SASE and sample-transmitted spectra (Boutet & Hunter, 2018; Katayama et al., 2013; Brenner et al., 2019). Such spectrometers are also useful in high-pressure or high-energy density science, where scans have to be performed with a small number of shots, preventing monochromator scans (Harmand et al., 2015). A large advantage in recording absorption spectra with the full SASE mode compared with the use of monochromatic light is that extreme intensity fluctuations are avoided, if the SASE spectrum does not contain the photon energy chosen by the monochromator (Boutet & Hunter, 2018). The SASE spectrum also carries useful information to set up FEL operational parameters and develop new operating modes (Rehanek et al., 2017) and can be used to estimate pulse durations from the measurements of spectral spike widths (Malyzhenkov et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2017; Makita et al., 2015).  \n  \n Several different spectrometer designs have been used at FELs for these kinds of spectral characterizations (Inubushi et al., 2012; Boesenberg et al., 2017; Rich et al., 2016; Svetina et al., 2016; Makita et al., 2015; Tono et al., 2013). Experiments at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) used bent Si crystals with transmission gratings (Makita et al., 2015). The bent Si crystals approach achieved high-resolution measurements (better than $0 . 2 \\ : \\mathrm { e V }$ at $8 . 3 \\mathrm { k e V }$ ), but were limited in spectral range and lost about half of the photon flux due to poor transmission (Zhu et al., 2012) while the transmission gratings had a poorer resolution $( 1 . 2 \\mathrm { e V }$ at $6  { \\mathrm { k e V } _ { , } }$ but much better transmission (Karvinen et al., 2012). The SPring-8 Angstrom Compact Free Electron Laser (SACLA) used a transmission grating in combination with an elliptical mirror and a flat Si crystal to deliver online spectra with tunability in both resolution and spectral range (Katayama et al., 2016). The Swiss-FEL photon single-shot spectrometer (PSSS) (Rehanek et al., 2017) combines a transmission grating with bent Si crystals to create a spectrometer that has a good resolution, large spectral range, and good transmission for online spectral measurements of photon energies between 4 and $1 3 \\mathrm { k e V } .$ Using this setup, the first order of the diffracted beam is used for spectral or intensity monitoring, while the zeroth order is transmitted downstream of the experiments.  \n  \n This work presents the achievements and the characterized capabilities of the PSSS as a single-shot online $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray spectrometer. We demonstrate that the PSSS can deliver a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) resolution of $\\Delta E / E \\simeq$ $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ and a spectral window of up to $0 . 7 \\%$ of the photon energy over the working range of the device.  \n 2. Setup  \n The working principle of the PSSS is shown in Fig. 1. The diamond grating diffracts the incoming FEL beam in the horizontal plane, sending the first order to the bent crystal spectrometer while the zeroth order continues further downstream with $8 0 \\%$ or more of the incoming flux. Monitoring the spectra online in this fashion reduces the heat load on the spectrometer optics (Boesenberg et al., 2017). The first order is Bragg-reflected from the bent Si crystal in the spectrometer and projected onto a detector, as shown in Fig. 1. The detector is a PCO:Edge 5.5 camera with an objective that is focused onto a Ce:YAG scintillator. The diffraction gratings have pitches of $1 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , $1 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ and $2 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . The grating pitches are chosen such that the first-order diffracted beam is always far enough from the zeroth order so that the crystals can be put safely into it and do not block or affect the propagation of the main beam to the experimental station downstream. The first-order efficiency can be enhanced by tilting the diamond gratings up to $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . For the bent Si crystals, three Si(220) crystals with bending radii of $7 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ , $1 4 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , and one Si(111) crystal with a bending radius of $1 5 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ can be chosen. All of the Si crystals are $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick. More information about the PSSS construction are given by Rehanek et al. (2017) and Juranic´ et al. (2018).  \n  \n Additional profile monitors situated both before and after the Bragg crystal chambers allow for the destructive observation of the diffracted beam and to see the Bragg diffraction in transmission. These monitors are Ce:YAG scintillators with a camera/lens unit (Juranic´ et al., 2018). Fig. $2 ( a )$ shows the diffracted beam on the profile monitor, while Fig. $2 ( b )$ shows the raw image of the spectrum on the PCO.Edge camera of the spectrometer. The RMS size of the photon beam in the horizontal and vertical directions at the PSSS ranges from about 150 to $4 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , depending on the photon energy and operating mode.  \n  \n The PSSS setup requires precise alignment of the Si bent crystals to the beam. The vertical position of the crystal is the most important parameter to maximize the signal once the correct Bragg angles were selected for a chosen energy window. The setup is typically conducted in the non-invasive mode: the diamond gratings upstream diffract the beam, and the analyser crystals are placed in the first diffraction order. An exemplary measurement, conducted at $1 2 \\mathrm { k e V }$ photon energy and with a pulse energy of approximately $1 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { J } ,$ is shown in Fig. $3 ( a )$ .  \n The precise energy calibration of the spectrometer was performed by inserting several filter foils into the beam and identifying the transmission edges. By fitting the observed position on the camera to the expected Bragg angles, the geometry, miscut of the crystals and mounting tolerances were taken into account. The used foils were Ti $K$ -edge $4 . 9 6 6 \\mathrm { k e V } ,$ $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thickness), Mn ( $K$ -edge $6 . 5 4 \\mathrm { k e V } _ { ; }$ , $2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thickness), Fe ( $K$ -edge $7 . 1 1 \\mathrm { k e V } ,$ , $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thickness), Ni ( $K$ -edge $8 . 3 3 \\mathrm { k e V } ,$ $1 2 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thickness) and $\\mathrm { c u }$ ( $K \\cdot$ -edge $8 . 9 8 \\mathrm { k e V } ,$ , $2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thickness). The photon energy of the FEL was set to the absorption edges of the foils, and the Bragg angle of the PSSS was scanned to find the motor positions that matched the photon energies of the absorption edges for all crystals. The measured points were then used to fit a theoretical Bragg curve with an additional free parameter to take the miscut of the crystals into account. These fits were then used to create a look-up table for all relevant motor positions across the energy window for each crystal. The resulting points and Bragg curves are shown in Fig. $3 ( b )$ . Note that we also show the Bragg curves without miscuts for Si(111) and Si(220) (dashed lines).  \n  \n The sensitivity across the detector was investigated by scanning the detector position perpendicular to the Bragg reflection and comparing the integrated intensity against the simultaneous measurements taken with the online gas-based pulse energy monitor (Juranic´ et al., 2018). The field of view of the detector is about $4 \\mathrm { m m }$ , so the spectra becomes cut off as one approaches that limit, and the integrated intensity drops off as a part of the spectrum is cut out, as shown in Figs. 3(c) and $3 ( d )$ .  \n 3. PSSS performance and discussion  \n 3.1. Operational parameters  \n 3.1.1. Si crystals and transmission gratings. The first step of the PSSS commissioning process was to determine the performance of different Si crystals and transmission gratings. From the Bragg angles [Fig. $3 ( b ) ]$ , we can see the reachable energy windows for the different silicon crystals. The Si(220)  \n reflection can be used over the complete range of the PSSS (4 to $1 3 \\mathrm { \\ k e V } ,$ ), while the Si(111) reflections can be used from $4  { \\mathrm { k e V } }$ to $8 \\mathrm { k e V }$ due to the limited range of the detector rotation stage due to other beamline components, limiting us to Bragg reflections from $1 4 ^ { \\circ }$ to $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ .  \n Fig. $4 ( a )$ shows the dependence of the separation of the zeroth- and first-order beams as a function of photon energy for the three available diamond gratings with 100, 150 and $2 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ pitches. The region between $1 4 ^ { \\circ }$ and $6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ is where noninvasive operation of the PSSS is possible, corresponding to between $3 \\mathrm { m m }$ and $8 \\mathrm { m m }$ beam separation. Fig. $4 ( b )$ shows the calculated transmission of the diamond gratings as a function of photon energy, calculated with the Henke tables (Henke et al., 1993; http://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/tgrat2.html). The transmitted beam has a transmission between $8 0 \\%$ at $4  { \\mathrm { k e V } }$ and $9 8 \\%$ at $1 3 \\mathrm { k e V }$ photon energy. The transmission efficiency of the gratings has been measured and reported elsewhere (Juranic et al., 2019).  \n 3.1.2. Si crystal alignment, energy calibration and detector sensitivity. The average integrated intensity of the spectra on the detector shows a very strong dependence on the vertical position of the bent Si crystal in the beam, as shown in Fig. $3 ( a )$ . The integrated intensity drops by about $5 0 \\%$ for a $1 1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ displacement of the crystal for an optimum position, highlighting the sensitivity of the device to misalignments and shifts in the beam position.  \n The difference between the measured Bragg angle values and those expected from the calculations are explained by the miscuts in the manufacturing process of the Si crystals (Rehanek et al., 2017). The offset between the measured crystal angles and the ideal Bragg angles is obvious in Fig. 3(b), where the three different Si(220) crystals have slightly different Bragg curves, offset from each other by a constant. The angular offsets of the Bragg angle for the four crystals were determined from these fits, and are shown in Table 1.  \n Fig. $3 ( c )$ shows the average spectra plotted as a function of the sensor position perpendicular to the Bragg reflection. The sensitivity seems to be homogeneous over the scanned region, though the spectra, and the integrated intensity, start being clipped and reduced as the spectrum is moved out of the sensor’s field of view. Fig. $3 ( d )$ indicates that the best sensor position for the spectral center to minimize this clipping is between $- 2 . 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ and $1 \\mathrm { m m }$ , giving about a $3 . 5 \\mathrm { { m m } }$ effective field of view to reliably observe the spectrum.  \n Table: Caption: Table 1 Bragg angle offsets due to miscuts for the four bent crystals.

FEL beam profile. Previous work has noted that the spectral intensity distribution can depend on the part of the FEL beam profile that is being Bragg reflected by the crystals (Makita et al., 2015; Rehanek et al., 2017). The homogeneity of the beam profile across the sampled portion of the beam being Bragg reflected should be as good as possible to ensure good spectral intensity measurements.  \n Fig. $5 ( a )$ shows the profile of the transmitted beam with a Bragg crystal positioned on the main beam (without the use of a diamond grating) that was acquired with a profile monitor downstream of the Bragg crystals (attenuated to avoid saturation). The diffracted portion of the beam is revealed by the small intensity drop in the beam center. The amount of the Bragg reflection is estimated as the maximum difference between the sides and the Bragg dip in the middle of the profile, as shown in Fig. $5 ( b )$ . The dip in signal due to the Bragg reflection is about $5 \\%$ near the maximum. From the tiny amount of the diffraction and the uniformity of the transmitted beam profile, we anticipate that the influence of the intensity on the measured spectral distribution of the beam is negligible as long as the Bragg crystal is centered.  \n 3.1.4. Measured energy resolution and spectral range. Fig. 6 shows the expected PSSS resolution at several different photon energies. The measurements were taken with the PSSS non-invasive mode, looking at the first order of the transmission grating. There are two measures to determine the resolution of a spectrometer: the minimum spike width that it can resolve, and the minimum peak separation that is still visible. The evaluation for these two values was performed using the Python Scipy library which evaluated the peaks whose prominence was at least ten times above the standard deviation of the noise in the background signal at the edges of the spectrum. The smallest separation between these peaks was considered as the best resolution observed. The peaks were then fitted with a Gaussian model (including an offset) to find their widths. Those peaks that had the offset near the background level of the spectrum were compared, and the smallest sigma values of these peaks was taken as the best sigma width resolution. A thousand spectra were evaluated to find the smallest sigma values and peak separations for each photon energy. Fig. 6 shows the minimum spike width and peak separation that were observed at $4 . 9 6 6 \\mathrm { k e V } ,$ $7 . 1 1 4 \\mathrm { k e V } ,$ ， $8 . 3 3 3 \\mathrm { ~ k e V } ,$ $8 . 9 9 6 \\mathrm { k e V }$ and $1 2 . 0 1 5 \\mathrm { k e V }$ photon energies and compares them with the expected values. They are also compared with each other and expected theoretical values in Table 2, which were evaluated using the expected beam size for that photon energy.  \n  \n Note that the measurements for the minimum spike width are a convolution of the resolution of the spectrometer and the natural spike width of the FEL spectrum, which likely limits the measurable energy resolution.  \n Table: Caption: Table 2 Expected theoretical and measured resolutions by photon energy; the measured resolutions were evaluated using peak separations and by looking at the smallest peak widths found. Body: <html><body><table><tr><td>Photon energy (eV)</td><td>Expected resolution (eV)</td><td>Peak separation (eV)</td><td>Sigma width (eV)</td></tr><tr><td>4966</td><td>0.174</td><td>0.076</td><td>0.066</td></tr><tr><td>7112</td><td>0.263</td><td>0.248</td><td>0.646</td></tr><tr><td>8333</td><td>0.250</td><td>0.177</td><td>0.237</td></tr><tr><td>8996</td><td>0.315</td><td>0.337</td><td>0.309</td></tr><tr><td>12015</td><td>0.610</td><td>0.816</td><td>0.462</td></tr></table></body></html> \n  \n The sigma and peak separation measurements are specifically close to the expected energy resolution for the Si(220) crystal with $R = 1 5 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ , and reasonably close to the crystal with $R = 2 0 0 \\ : \\mathrm { m m }$ . It is possible that the photon spectrum at this energy was not as optimized as the other ones, causing the spectrum itself to have broader spikes. However, the resolution of the spectrometer stays in the $1 0 ^ { - 5 } \\ \\Delta E / E$ resolution range for all measurements, matching the expectations set during the device design.  \n The spectral range of the PSSS matched the theoretical estimates (Rehanek et al., 2017), ranging between $0 . 5 6 \\%$ and $0 . 7 4 \\%$ with the correct selection of Bragg crystals and bending radii. Si(220) crystals with bending radii of $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ , $1 4 5 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and $7 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ are used for ranges of $5 . 5 { - } 8 \\mathrm { k e V } _ { \\mathrm { \\Omega } }$ $8 – 1 0 . 5 \\mathrm { k e V }$ and $1 0 . 5 { \\mathrm { - } } 1 3 \\mathrm { ~ k e V } ,$ respectively. A Si(111) crystal with a bending radius of $1 5 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ is used to provide a similar spectral range for photon energies between 4 and $5 . 5 \\mathrm { k e V . }$ The range is large enough to clearly visualize the standard mode spectrum and its tails, as seen in Fig. 6.  \n 3.2. Experience with the PSSS  \n The PSSS went into full operation for users and machine operators after the implementation of a user-friendly graphical user interface for spectral measurements based on look-up tables created from the calibration data. To further help with the optimization of the FEL spectral settings, a fast algorithm was developed to evaluate the center of energy and the FWHM of a Gaussian fit to the smoothed spectrum on a shot-to-shot basis. Further tools created by the accelerator scientists use this data for feedbacks for the machine, and the PSSS is being used regularly to correct drifts and instabilities of the mean photon energy and spectral width via a feedback system and an optimizer to the SwissFEL accelerator settings. The PSSS has been used even when the end-stations use monochromators for an experiment, as the PSSS spectral bandwidth evaluation can be used to optimize the smallest bandwidth the FEL can achieve so that the maximum amount of photons possible pass through a monochromator’s bandpass, increasing the signal at the experiment. A good example of such an optimization feedback, and its effect on stabilizing the photon energy, is shown in Fig. 7. Overall, the device has been extremely helpful for machine optimization and experimental work.  \n 4. Conclusions  \n The PSSS enables the online monitoring of shot-to-shot fluctuations in spectral properties of the FEL, delivering a spectral range of up to $0 . 7 6 \\%$ of the photon energy, and a resolution of bandwidths $\\Delta E / E < 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ , consistent with the theoretical estimates. Using Fe, Ni and Cu $K$ -edges from XAS spectra from reference data from synchrotrons, the spectrometer was calibrated to be capable of visualizing the FEL spectrum in the standard mode while preserving high-resolution visualization of individual spikes. The PSSS enables the operators and users of the Aramis beamline to monitor and optimize the performance of the FEL and the experiment online, and is a crucial component of the SwissFEL diagnostics suite.  \n  \n "

(Science Press), Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Nuclear Society 2021  \n Abstract A corrugated structure is built and tested on many FEL facilities, providing a ‘dechirper’ mechanism for eliminating energy spread upstream of the undulator section of X-ray FELs. The wakefield effects are here studied for the beam dechirper at the Shanghai high repetition rate XFEL and extreme light facility (SHINE), and compared with analytical calculations. When properly optimized, the energy spread is well compensated. The transverse wakefield effects are also studied, including the dipole and quadrupole effects. By using two orthogonal dechirpers, we confirm the feasibility of restraining the emittance growth caused by the quadrupole wakefield. A more efficient method is thus proposed involving another pair of orthogonal dechirpers.  \n Keywords Corrugated structure $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot \\mathbf { \\varepsilon }$ Energy spread $\\cdot$ Wakefield $\\mathbf { \\nabla } \\cdot \\mathbf { \\varepsilon }$ Shanghai high repetition rate XFEL and extreme light facility  \n 1 Introduction  \n Eliminating residual energy chirps is essential for optimizing the beam brightness in the undulator of a free electron laser (FEL). There are currently two traditional ways to eliminate chirps in superconducting linear accelerator (linac)-driven X-ray FEL facilities. One involves exploiting the resistive-wall wakefield induced by the beam pipe. The other option, which involves running the beam ‘off-crest,’ is inefficient and costly, especially for ultrashort bunches in FEL facilities [1]. Recently, corrugated metallic structures have attracted much interest within the accelerator community, as they use a wakefield to remove linear energy chirps passively before the beam enters the undulator. The idea of using a corrugated structure as a dechirper in an X-ray FEL was first proposed by Karl and Gennady [1]. Several such structures, XFELs [2], PALXFEL [3], pint-sized facility [4, 5], LCLS [6] and SwissFEL [7] have been built and tested. The feasibility of employing a corrugated structure to precisely control the beam phase space has been demonstrated in various applications. It has also been utilized as a longitudinal beam phase-space linearizer for bunch compression [8, 9], to linearize energy profiles for FEL lasing [10], and as a passive deflector for longitudinal phase-space reconstruction [11]. Meanwhile, many other novel applications of light sources have also been proposed in recent years. Bettoni et al. verified the possibility of using them to generate a two-color beam [12]. A new role for generating fresh-slice multi-color generations in FELs was demonstrated in LCLS [13]. The generation of terahertz waves was also proposed recently [14].  \n This paper begins by reviewing the dechirper parameters for a small metallic pipe. The wakefield effects are studied with an ultra-short electron bunch in the Shanghai high repetition rate XFEL and extreme light facility (SHINE). Then, the process in dechirper is studied analytically and verified by numerical simulations. The longitudinal wakefield generated by the corrugated structure was adopted as the dechirper was calculated and simulated for SHINE. The following chapter focuses on the transverse wakefield, discussing emittance dilution effects on different arrangements of two orthogonally oriented dechirpers, mainly for the case of an on-axis beam. We also propose using ‘fourdechirpers’ as a novel approach for controlling the beam emittance dilution effect during dechirping and compare it with the conventional scheme. We then close with a brief conclusion.  \n  \n 2 Background  \n The layout of the SHINE linac and the beam parameters along the beamline are shown in Fig. 1. The electron beam generated by the VHF gun is accelerated to $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M e V }$ before entering the laser heater, to suppress potential subsequent microbunching by increasing the uncorrelated energy spread of the beam. The overall linac system consists of four accelerating sections (L1, L2, L3 and L4) and two bunch compressors (BC1 and BC2). A higher harmonic linearizer (HL), which works in the deceleration phase, is also placed upstream of BC1 for the purpose of linear compression.  \n The SHINE linac beam specifications are listed in Table 1. After two stages of bunch compressors, the bunch length is shortened to $1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , with a time-dependent energy chirp of approximately $0 . 2 5 \\%$ $( 2 0 \\mathrm { M e V } )$ at the exit of the SHINE linac. Compared with normal conducting RF structures, the wakefield generated by the L-band superconducting structure is relatively weak because of its large aperture [15]. Therefore, it is impossible to compensate the correlated energy spread of the beam by adopting the longitudinal wakefield of the accelerating module, which becomes a key design feature of superconducting linacdriven FELs. In the case of the SHINE linac, the electron bunch length is less than $1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ after passing through the second bunch compressor. Therefore, the beam energy spread cannot be effectively compensated by chirping the RF phase of the main linac. The SHINE linac adopts the corrugated structure (Fig. 2) to dechirp the energy spread. This is achieved by deliberately selecting the structural parameters so as to control the wavelength and strength of the field, as verified by beam experiments on many FEL facilities.  \n Table: Caption: Table 1 Beam parameters upon exiting the SHINE linac Body: <html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>Energy,E (GeV)</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Charge per bunch, Q (PC)</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Beam current,I (kA)</td><td>1.5</td></tr><tr><td>Bunch length (RMS),σ(μm)</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>βx (m)</td><td>60.22</td></tr><tr><td>βy (m)</td><td>43.6</td></tr><tr><td>αx</td><td>1.257</td></tr><tr><td>αy</td><td>1.264</td></tr><tr><td>Enx (mm·mrad)</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td>Eny (mm·mrad)</td><td>0.29</td></tr></table></body></html> \n  \n 3 Longitudinal Wakefield effect  \n Round pipes and rectangular plates are usually adopted as dechirpers. Round pipes perform better on the longitudinal wakefield by a factor of $1 6 / \\pi ^ { 2 }$ relative to a rectangular plate of comparable dimensions. However, SHINE uses a rectangular plate nonetheless, as its gap can be adjusted by changing the two plates. The corrugated structure is made of aluminum with small periodic sags and crests, with the parameters defined in Fig. 2.  \n The surface impedance of a pipe with small, periodic corrugations has been described in detail [16–18]. The high-frequency longitudinal impedance for the dechirper can be determined by starting from the general impedance expression. Taking $q$ as the conjugate variable in the Fourier transform, we have  \n  \n $$\nZ _ { 1 } ( k ) = \\frac { 2 \\zeta } { c } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } \\mathrm { d } q q \\mathrm { c s c h } ^ { 3 } ( 2 q a ) f ( q ) e ^ { - i q x } ,\n$$ \n where $f ( q ) = n / d$ , and with  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { n = q [ \\cosh [ q ( 2 a - y - y _ { 0 } ) ] - 2 \\cosh [ q ( y - y _ { 0 } ) ] } \\\\ { \\qquad + \\cosh [ q ( 2 a + y + y _ { 0 } ) ] ] } \\\\ { \\qquad - i k \\zeta [ \\sinh [ q ( 2 a - y - y _ { 0 } ) ] + \\sinh [ q ( 2 a + y + y _ { 0 } ) ] ] , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n $$\nd = [ q \\mathrm { s e c h } ( q a ) - i k \\zeta \\mathrm { c s c h } ( q a ) ] [ q \\mathrm { c s c h } ( q a ) - i k \\zeta \\mathrm { s e c h } ( q a ) ] .\n$$ \n We use $( x _ { 0 } , \\ y _ { 0 } )$ and $( x , y )$ to represent the driving and testing particles, respectively. In Eq. (1), the surface impedance is written as $\\zeta$ , which is related to the wavenumber $k$ . In Ref. [18], the impedance at large $k$ is expanded, keeping terms to leading order $1 / k$ and to the next order $1 / k ^ { 3 / 2 }$ . Then, we compare this equation to the round case for a disk-loaded structure in a round geometry, with the same expression in parameters as rectangular plates. The longitudinal impedances at large $q$ for the round and rectangular plates are given by [18–21]  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle { Z _ { \\mathrm { { r } } } ( k ) = \\frac { 4 i } { k c a ^ { 2 } } \\left[ 1 + \\frac { 1 + i } { \\sqrt { 2 k S _ { 0 \\mathrm { { r } } } } } \\right] ^ { - 1 } , } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle { Z _ { \\mathrm { { l } } } ( k ) = \\frac { 4 i } { k c a ^ { 2 } } \\left[ 1 + \\frac { 1 + i } { \\sqrt { 2 k S _ { 0 \\mathrm { { l } } } } } \\right] ^ { - 1 } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The distance scale factors $S _ { \\mathrm { 0 r } }$ and $S _ { 0 1 }$ for the round and flat are strongly influenced by the dechirper parameters:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle S _ { 0 \\mathrm { r } } = \\frac { a ^ { 2 } t } { 2 \\pi \\alpha ^ { 2 } p ^ { 2 } } , } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle \\alpha ( x ) = 1 - 0 . 4 6 5 \\sqrt { ( x ) } - 0 . 0 7 0 ( x ) , } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle S _ { 0 1 } = 9 S _ { 0 \\mathrm { r } } / 4 . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n After calculating the inverse Fourier transformation, the distance s between the test and driving particles yields the longitudinal wake at the origin of $s = 0 ^ { + }$ , according to $w _ { \\mathrm { l } } \\sim e ^ { \\sqrt { s / s _ { 0 1 } } }$ . The relationship between the longitudinal point wake and the distance about the test charge behind the driving charge is expressed as Eq. (8) [19].  \n $$\nw _ { 1 } ( s ) = - \\frac { \\pi Z _ { 0 } c } { 1 6 a ^ { 2 } } e ^ { - \\sqrt { s / s _ { 0 1 } } } .\n$$ \n The wakefield of the short bunch is obtained by convoluting the wake with the bunch shape $\\lambda ( s )$ . For a pencil beam, the original wake $w _ { 0 }$ on the axis becomes [19]  \n $$\nw _ { 0 } = \\frac { \\pi Z _ { 0 } c } { 1 6 a ^ { 2 } } .\n$$ \n Equation (8) shows that the required dechirper length $L$ is determined by the half-gap for a given dechirper strength. The half-gap $a = 1 \\mathrm { m m }$ was chosen as the baseline for the following reasons. On the one hand, it ensures that a sufficiently large proportion of the beam is included in the clear region for beam propagation, an essential requirement for controlling beam loss in a superconducting linac. On the other hands, the aperture size is constrained by the transverse emittance dilution effect, which is discussed in the following section. In [26], it is assumed that the corrugation dimensions are no greater than the gap size, i.e., $t , p \\leq a$ . This ensures that the structure is ‘steeply corrugated,’ such that short-range wakes can be neglected.  \n As described in Eq. (567), the distance factor is affected by the dechirper parameters, especially by the ratio $t / p$ . The wakefields induced by the Gaussian bunch with different $t /$ $p$ values are shown in Fig. 3. Over the initial $2 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , all the induced wakefields have the same slope coefficient and differ mainly in terms of the maximal chirp. As $t / p$ increases, the wakefield decreases progressively until it settles when $t / p$ reaches 0.5. Therefore, $t / p = 0 . 5$ is selected for SHINE as the dechirper parameter for which deviations are tolerable.  \n Equation (1) is suitable only for dechirpers with a flat geometry, with corrugations in the $y -$ and $z$ -directions and with $x$ extending to infinity horizontally. However, in practice, it assumes the presence of a resistive wall in the $x$ - direction, as defined by the width $w$ . The wake calculated in the time domain by the wakefield solver ECHO2D [22] is adopted to simulate the actual situation. This is expressed as a sum of discrete modes, with odd mode numbers m corresponding to the horizontal mode wavenumbers $k x =$ $m \\pi / \\nu$ $( m = 1 , 3 , 5 . . . )$ . To obtain the exact simulated wakefield, it has been verified that $w \\gg a$ should be satisfied, and that more than one mode contribute to the impedance of the structure [17].  \n  \n As previously mentioned, $t / p = 0 . 5$ was adopted. The longitudinal wakefields corresponding to different widths are shown in the middle subplot of Fig. 3. The longitudinal wakefield appears to increase with $w$ , but settles at a maximum value when $w = 1 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ . For our calculation, setting $a = 1 \\mathrm { m m }$ and $w = 1 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ yields a sufficiently large ratio $w / a = 1 5$ . The scenarios in Eq. (1) and ECHO2D can all be regarded as flat geometries. The main parameters chosen for SHINE are summarized in Table 2.  \n Assuming that the beam goes through an actual periodic structure, the beam entering the finite-length pipe still displays a transient response, characterized by the catch-up distance $z = a ^ { 2 } / 2 \\sigma _ { z }$ . Based on the parameters in Table 2, the catch-up distance in SHINE is $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ , which is small compared to the structure length, suggesting that the transient response of the structure can be ignored.  \n Table: Caption: Table 2 Corrugated structural parameters for SHINE Body: <html><body><table><tr><td>Parameter</td><td>Value</td></tr><tr><td>Half-gap, a (mm)</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td>Period,p (mm)</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Depth,h (mm)</td><td>0.5</td></tr><tr><td>Longitudinal gap,t (mm)</td><td>0.25</td></tr><tr><td>Width,w (mm)</td><td>15.0</td></tr><tr><td>Plate length,L (m)</td><td>10.0</td></tr></table></body></html> \n  \n The effect of a high group velocity in the radiation pulse also merits discussion. At the end of the structure length, the pulse length can be expressed [1] as $l _ { \\mathrm { p } } = 2 h t L / a p$ . For the structural parameters of SHINE, we have $l _ { \\mathrm { p } } = 5 \\mathrm { m }$ which is much longer than the actual bunch length of the particle. This effect does not have to be taken.  \n During RF acceleration and beam transportation, the electron beam traveling from the VHF gun to the linac is affected by several beam-dynamic processes. These include the space-charge effect in the injector, the wakefield effect from SC structures, coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and non-linear effects during bunch compression [23]. Non-linearities in both the accelerating fields and the longitudinal dispersion can distort the longitudinal phase space. The typical final double-horn current distribution after the SHINE linac is shown in Fig. 4. The particles are concentrated within the first $2 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ with a linear energy spread.  \n The wakefield for the actual simulated bunch distribution is shown in Fig. 5. Compared with the Gaussian and rectangular bunch distributions, as the head-tail wakefield effect of the beam, the double-horn bunch distribution distorts the expected chirp from the Gaussian bunch. The high peak current at the head of the beam complicates the situation further. The maximal chirp generated at different positions is also related to the feature in the bunch distribution. The particles in the double-horn bunch descend steeply over $1 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , but the particles in the Gaussian and rectangular bunches hold a gender distribution. Nevertheless, the chirp induced by the double-horn beam distribution in less than $5 \\%$ differences in the maximal chirp and shows great correspondence on the tail. This proves that the analytical method is also perfectly suitable for the actual bunch in SHINE.  \n  \n According to the middle subplot in Fig. 5, the wakefield generated by the same structural parameters in the corrugated structure depends mainly on the shape of the bunch. As shown in the bottom of Fig. 5, with the longitudinal wakefield by the actual bunch, the energy chirp in the positive slope after L4 in SHINE can be well compensated. We can conclude that the longitudinal wake generated by the corrugated structure over $1 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ is adequate and effective at canceling the energy chirp passively.  \n 4 Transverse Wakefield effect  \n For the part of the beam near the axis of plates, $w _ { \\mathrm { y d } }$ and $w _ { y \\mathbf { q } }$ are defined as the transverse quadrupole and dipole wakes, where the driving and test particle coordinates $y _ { 0 }$ and ${ \\boldsymbol { y } } \\ll { \\boldsymbol { a } }$ . For a driving particle at $( x _ { 0 } , \\ y _ { 0 } )$ and a test particle at $( x , y )$ , the transverse wake is given by [24]  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\begin{array} { r c l } { w _ { y } = y _ { 0 } w _ { y \\mathrm { d } } + y w _ { y \\mathrm { q } } , } \\\\ { w _ { x } = ( x _ { 0 } - x ) w _ { y \\mathrm { q } } . } \\end{array} } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Expanding the surface impedance $\\zeta ~ [ 1 8 ]$ in the first two orders, the short-range vertical dipole and quadrupole wakes near the axis are given by [19]  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { w _ { y \\mathrm { d } } \\approx \\displaystyle \\frac { Z _ { 0 } \\mathrm { c } \\pi ^ { 3 } } { 6 4 a ^ { 4 } } { \\mathit { s } } _ { 0 \\mathrm { d } } \\bigg [ 1 - \\big ( 1 + \\sqrt { { s } / { s } _ { 0 \\mathrm { d } } } \\big ) e ^ { \\sqrt { { s } / { s } _ { 0 \\mathrm { d } } } } \\bigg ] , } \\\\ & { w _ { y \\mathrm { q } } \\approx \\displaystyle \\frac { Z _ { 0 } \\mathrm { c } \\pi ^ { 3 } } { 6 4 a ^ { 4 } } { \\mathit { s } } _ { 0 \\mathrm { q } } \\bigg [ 1 - \\big ( 1 + \\sqrt { { s } / { s } _ { 0 \\mathrm { q } } } \\big ) e ^ { \\sqrt { { s } / { s } _ { 0 \\mathrm { q } } } } \\bigg ] , } \\\\ & { { \\mathit { s } } _ { 0 \\mathrm { d } } = s _ { 0 \\mathrm { r } } \\bigg ( \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 5 } { 1 4 } \\bigg ) ^ { 2 } , { \\mathit { s } } _ { 0 \\mathrm { q } } = s _ { 0 \\mathrm { r } } \\bigg ( \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 5 } { 1 6 } \\bigg ) ^ { 2 } . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Figure 6 compares the dipole and quadrupole wakes obtained by convolving with the actual bunch distribution in SHINE and the analytical results verified with the simulated results from the ECHO2D code [22]. Assuming that the beam is close to (and nearly on) the axis, there is good agreement between the numerical and analytical results for the dipole and quadrupole wakes.  \n When the beam is centered off-axis, the emittance growth is generated by the transverse dipole and quadrupole wakefields, leading to a deterioration in the beam brightness. Regardless of whether the beam is at the center, the quadrupole wake focuses in the $x$ -direction and defocuses in the $y -$ direction, increasingly from the head to the tail. This in turn results in an increase in the projected emittance. However, care must be taken that the slice emittance is not affected by the dipole and quadrupole wakes taken by these two orders. For the case of a short uniform bunch near the axis, the quadrupole and dipole inverse focal lengths are given by [25]  \n  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { f _ { \\mathrm { { q } } } ^ { - 1 } ( s ) = k _ { \\mathrm { { q } } } ^ { 2 } ( s ) L = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\pi ^ { 3 } } { 2 5 6 a ^ { 4 } } Z _ { 0 } c \\left( \\displaystyle \\frac { e Q L } { E l } \\right) s ^ { 2 } , } } \\\\ { { f _ { \\mathrm { { d } } } ^ { - 1 } ( s ) = k _ { \\mathrm { { d } } } ^ { 2 } ( s ) L = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\pi ^ { 3 } } { 1 2 8 a ^ { 4 } } Z _ { 0 } c \\left( \\displaystyle \\frac { e Q L } { E l } \\right) s ^ { 2 } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $k _ { \\mathrm { q } } ( s )$ is the effective quadrupole strength, which changes with $s$ within the bunch length $l$ .  \n For the case where the beam is near the axis, a short uniformly distributed bunch was deduced in Ref. [25] to calculate the emittance growth after passing through the dechirper. As mentioned above, Eq. (9) is substituted into Eq. (50) of Ref. [25] to completely eliminate $2 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ from the invariant:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\left( \\frac { \\epsilon _ { y } } { \\epsilon _ { y 0 } } \\right) = \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\frac { 1 0 ^ { 7 } \\pi ^ { 2 } l \\beta _ { y } } { 6 \\sqrt { 5 } a ^ { 2 } E } \\right) ^ { 2 } \\left( 1 + \\frac { 4 y _ { \\mathrm { c } } ^ { 2 } } { \\sigma _ { y } ^ { 2 } } \\right) \\right] ^ { 1 / 2 } . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Based on the SHINE parameters, Fig. 7 shows the growth in emittance for different beam offsets. The value of $y _ { \\mathrm { c } }$ is proven to be a significant factor for determining the projected emittance. When the beam is near the axis and the gap $\\mathrm { ~ a ~ } \\geqslant \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ m m ~ }$ , the effect on the growth in emittance induced by the dipole wakefield is tolerable. Hence, as a point of technique in beamline operation, maintaining the beam on-axis is an effective way to restrain emittance growth.  \n We next simply consider the quadrupole wake, where the beam is on-axis $( \\mathrm { y } _ { \\mathrm { c } } = 0 )$ . The transfer matrices for the focusing and defocusing quadrupole are given in Eq. (16), where $L$ is the length of the corrugated structure [25].  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\boldsymbol { R } _ { \\mathrm { f } } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { c c } { \\cos k _ { \\mathrm { q } } L } & { \\frac { \\sin k _ { \\mathrm { q } } L } { k _ { \\mathrm { q } } } } \\\\ { - k _ { \\mathrm { q } } \\sin k _ { \\mathrm { q } } L } & { \\cos k _ { \\mathrm { q } } L } \\end{array} \\right] , \\boldsymbol { R } _ { \\mathrm { d } } = \\left[ \\begin{array} { c c } { \\cosh k _ { \\mathrm { q } } L } & { \\frac { \\sin k _ { \\mathrm { q } } L } { k _ { \\mathrm { q } } } } \\\\ { k _ { \\mathrm { q } } \\sinh k _ { \\mathrm { q } } L } & { \\cosh k _ { \\mathrm { q } } L } \\end{array} \\right] . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n One proposal for effectively preventing the growth in emittance caused by the quadrupole wake was to divide the dechirper into two orthogonal dechirpers [26]. This arrangement mode is explored based on beam-optics optimizations in SHINE.  \n First, the entire $1 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ length of the dechirper is required and divided into effectively two-dechirpers with $5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ intervals. The two sections are oriented orthogonally, one with the plates vertical and the other horizontal. We use $\\mathbf { \\nabla } ^ { \\left. \\mathbf { V } \\right. }$ and $\\mathbf { \\cdot } \\mathbf { H } ^ { \\mathbf { \\cdot } }$ to denote vertical and horizontal plates, respectively. Figure 8 shows the projected emittance growth for four different combinations. The results were verified and compared by simulation using ELEGANT [27]. As expected, while the combinations VV and HH yield a greater projected emittance growth even when the beam is perfectly aligned, the HV and VH combinations preserve the projected emittance effectively after the dechirper section. The different performances are caused by the features in the quadrupole wake. The quadrupole wake holds only one transverse direction in focus, with an equal defocusing strength in the other transverse directions. Therefore, VV and HH degenerate the transverse phase space in one direction, but VH and HV counteract the strength self-consistently.  \n To improve the beam quality in SHINE and maintain the projected emittance, we attempted to divide the dechirper into four sections of uniform length $2 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ (hereafter named ‘four-dechirpers’). The two-dechirper and four-dechirper layouts are depicted in Fig. 9 based on the FODO design. The blue ellipse represents the bunch on-axis. The transverse direction points perpendicular to the page, while the black arrow under the e-beam defines the longitudinal direction. The corrugated structures are orthogonal, distributed between the quadrupole magnets. One FODO structure is formed in the two-dechirper and two are formed in the four-dechirper.  \n The hypothesis on the beta functions is validated using a thick-lens calculation. The final transfer matrix is thus expressed as a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M _ { \\mathrm { f } }$ , and the original and final Twiss parameters, given by $( \\alpha _ { 0 } , \\beta _ { 0 } , \\gamma _ { 0 } )$ and $( \\alpha , \\beta , \\gamma )$ , respectively, are related as $\\gamma = ( 1 + \\alpha ^ { 2 } ) / \\beta$ .  \n As shown in Eq. (17) (where $< >$ [ denotes the numerical average obtained by integrating over the bunch length), the quadrupole wake transforms exactly like a magnetic quadrupole for any slice position in $s$ . By computing the transfer matrix with the structural parameters, the average of the final Twiss parameter and the emittance growth can be calculated as  \n $$\n\\epsilon _ { \\mathrm { f } } / \\epsilon _ { 0 } = ( \\langle \\gamma _ { \\mathrm { f } } \\rangle \\langle \\beta _ { \\mathrm { f } } \\rangle - \\langle \\alpha _ { \\mathrm { f } } \\rangle ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } ,\n$$ \n where the subscripts f o represent the final (original) situation. Then, the other plane is also suitable.  \n In contrast to the conventional FODO design, we utilized the two- and four-dechirpers, including the quadrupole wake generated in the corrugated structure. This destroys the periodicity in the Twiss parameters and causes the changes in the projected emittance in the final. The projected emittance growth for different magnet lengths $L$ and magnet strengths $K$ of the quadrupole magnets is demonstrated in Fig. 10. However, the minimum projected emittances in the two- and four-dechirpers are $0 . 0 1 7 5 \\%$ and $0 . 0 0 2 3 8 \\%$ , respectively. These values are comparatively small. The projected four-dechirper emittance still performs better. In the case of the symmetric feature in the FODO structure, the conclusion reached for the $x$ -direction does not apply to the $y$ -direction. The optimized working point (red dot) is selected for the quadrupole magnets, where the function $\\beta _ { x }$ is minimal and shows the best performance in terms of the emittance growth. The above calculation confirms the validity of dividing the dechirpers into four.  \n  \n The $\\beta$ functions for both models are plotted in Fig. 9. In [28], the emittance growth caused by the quadrupole wakefield is fully compensated only if $\\beta _ { x } = \\beta _ { y }$ . In practice, however, the beta functions always fluctuate, and the beam suffers from the residual quadrupole wakefield. For a period FODO cell, the difference between the maximum and minimum $\\beta$ values is given by Eq. (18) [29], where $K$ and $L$ denote the quadrupole strength and length separately, and $l$ the length for each separated dechirper (5 and $2 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ for the two- and four-dechirpers, respectively).  \n  \n $$\n\\beta _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } - \\beta _ { \\mathrm { m i n } } = { 4 l } / { \\sqrt { 6 4 - K ^ { 2 } L ^ { 2 } l ^ { 2 } } } .\n$$ \n Figure 11 compares the $\\beta$ functions for two- and fourdechirpers by scanning the magnet strength $K$ and the magnet length $L$ . The minimum differences are $2 . 5 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ and 1.25 for the two- and four-dechirpers, respectively. This implies a better compensation of the quadrupole wakefieldinduced emittance growth in the four-dechirper schemes. In practical engineering applications, four-dechirpers are considered appropriate to simplify the system.  \n Finally, the projected emittance changes for the twoand four-dechirpers were simulated separately in the actual bunch with the working point, as optimized. We also compared both schemes with the ELEGANT code using the actual bunch distribution with the optimized working point. The results are summarized in Table 3. The transverse phase space is shown in Fig. 12. Because of the mismatch in the actual bunch when it goes through either the two- or four-dechirper scheme, the actual bunch hardly maintains the projected emittance as analyzed. The $x$ and $x ^ { \\prime }$ in the Gaussian bunch are almost invariant, but the mismatch in the actual bunch cannot be ignored and must be taken into account. As a result, the actual bunch has a lower emittance in the four-dechirpers scheme. This therefore makes the four-dechirpers a more feasible and efficient scheme for preserving the emittance for SHINE.  \n 5 Brief conclusion and discussion  \n This study systematically investigated the effectiveness of using a corrugated structure as a passive device to remove residual beam chirp in the SHINE project. We simulated the application of the dechirper to the SHINE beam and studied the transverse and longitudinal wakefield effects. A detailed parameter optimization of the corrugated structure was carried out using analytic formulas. It was further verified using the ELEGANT particle-tracking code. Then, we compared the wakefield effects induced by the Gaussian and double-horn beams in SHINE. The results show good consistency and can facilitate further studies. To cancel the quadrupole wakefield effect, a scheme involving two orthogonal dechirpers was adopted. Different combination plans were compared to determine the best suppression of beam-emittance growth. Finally, we proposed a four-dechirper scheme to further improve the performance. The simulation results show that the new scheme is potentially a more effective option for SHINE.  \n Table: Caption: Table 3 Emittance growth generated by two- and four-dechirpers in the $x -$ and $y$ -directions Body: <html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"3\"></td><td colspan=\"4\">Gaussian bunch</td><td colspan=\"2\">Actual bunch</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Analytical results</td><td colspan=\"2\">Simulation</td><td colspan=\"2\">Simulation</td></tr><tr><td>Two-dechirpers (%)</td><td>Four-dechirpers (%)</td><td>Two-dechirpers (%)</td><td>Four-dechirpers (%)</td><td>Two-dechirpers (%)</td><td>Four-dechirpers (%)</td></tr><tr><td>Sex/Ex</td><td>0.0175</td><td>0.00238</td><td>0.209</td><td>0.008</td><td>0.647</td><td>-0.33</td></tr><tr><td>dEy/Ey</td><td>0.0031</td><td>0.0006</td><td>0.195</td><td>0.006</td><td>1.282</td><td>-0.36</td></tr></table></body></html> \n  \n Author Contributions All authors contributed to the study conception and design.

INTRODUCTION  \n Beam profile monitors are one of the primary instruments at accelerator facilities around the world for the characterization of particle beams as they pass through the various elements in the accelerator. Although these screens are simple devices in principle, the details of their implementation have become more and more complicated as the requirements for resolution and accuracy at accelerator facilities have become more sophisticated. The accelerators have become more complex in the kind of beams they deliver and the modes they provide.  \n X-ray free-electron lasers (FELs) are one of these more advanced accelerators that have been developed in the past two decades to provide laser-like $\\mathbf { x }$ -ray pulses. These machines accelerate bunches of electrons of nC or less charge down hundreds of meters or even kilometers of accelerators, through undulators, and generate fs-duration x-ray pulses for use by experimenters.1–7 The screens developed for the characterization of these electron beams have had to be adapted at these facilities, some having to adopt special geometries to direct coherent optical transition radiation (COTR) away from the camera, and with all having their resolution for beam size measurement being a key parameter.8–13 Here, we present a new design of the transverse profile monitors at SwissFEL,7 the x-ray FEL at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. The design is based on using high-quality filters and dynamic focusing. The new design results in a significantly better beam size resolution: we improve the resolution from 20 to $1 4 \\mu \\mathrm m$ .  \n  \n The evaluation of the beam size resolution of the screen profile monitors is usually first performed in a laboratory, using calibrated optical targets, and then sometimes checked in the beam itself. However, the in-beam checks can be difficult to execute properly without damaging the scintillators. The simplest way to evaluate the beam size resolution of the screen would be to focus the electron beam to a single point on the screen and record the resulting profile size on the monitor. However, this approach has the disadvantage that the tightly focused beam may damage the screen, degrading its performance and reliability. This article demonstrates a gentler way of determining the resolution of the screen while they are in use.  \n II. MEASUREMENT SETUP  \n The diagnostic screens (DSCRs) used at SwissFEL were developed to use a Scheimpflug geometry to minimize the effect of COTR generated from microbunching that may be present in the SwissFEL electron bunch on the profile measurement.10,14 An optical setup was developed to cover the large range of intensities that the scintillating effect would generate under various measurement regimes of the electron beam. The optical setup uses a Nikon $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m } \\mathrm { f } / 4$ ED-IF AF Micro lens set at a working distance of $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ from the scintillating screen. The Ce:YAG scintillating screen is in vacuum, with the light propagating through a $1 5 ^ { \\circ }$ Scheimpflug geometry, through a sapphire vacuum viewport, a mirror, and then into the lens, with a PCO.edge 5.5 camera behind it. The scintillating light has a wavelength range from about 500 to $7 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , with a maximum at $5 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . The design keeps the camera gain at a constant level to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the camera electronics and introduces a $1 \\%$ or $1 0 \\%$ neutral density (ND) filter about $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ before the lens along the optical path to reduce the intensity of the scintillator light going into the camera. This gives the system the ability to observe the image at $1 0 0 \\%$ , $1 0 \\%$ , $1 \\%$ , or $0 . 1 \\%$ transmission, depending on which combination of ND filters we insert, if any at all. The original chosen filters were Kodak filter foils. The thin foils were thought to have a minimal lensing effect on the optical setup due to their thinness. The optical components are centered on the optical path axis of the scintillated light. The preliminary measurements in an optical laboratory showed that the optical system should have a resolution of about $1 4 \\mu \\mathrm m$ . This diagnostic screen setup was tested at the SwissFEL test facility with a tightly focused, low-charge electron beam and showed a resolution of about $1 6 \\mu \\mathrm m$ .10 A schematic drawing of the setup is shown in Fig. 1.  \n  \n However, the first experimental use of these devices after installation to evaluate the emittance of the electron beam at SwissFEL showed that the resolution was significantly worse and was found to be between 20 and $4 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ when using the filters.15–17 An investigation of the filters showed that the thin film deforms and degrades over time and adds a blurring effect, spoiling the optical system resolution. The design was changed to use higher quality ND filters that are made of glass but would affect the optical path. This necessitated the addition of a motorized stage for the lens and camera system to be able to re-focus for every new filter setting, as shown in Fig. 2. This new setup differs from the original in that it allows for changes of the optical path to control the focusing and in the quality of the filters. All other components are unchanged.  \n  \n After the optimization of the camera and lens position to find the best focus for each ND filter combination, we set the control system for the DSCRs so that the proper position would be set for every ND filter combination and resulting transmission.  \n We obtained the screen resolution by measuring the beam size for different electron beam energies, while keeping the same emittance and optics. The measured beam size has two contributions: (1) the true beam size, which can be expressed as $\\sqrt { \\beta \\varepsilon / \\gamma } , ^ { 1 8 }$ where $\\beta$ is the beta-function of the electron beam, $\\pmb { \\varepsilon }$ is the norma/lized emittance, and $\\gamma$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor of the electron beam (with $\\gamma$ being the electron beam energy divided by $m _ { e } c ^ { 2 }$ ), and (2) the screen resolution $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { s c r } }$ . Since the two components are, in principle, not correlated, the square of the measured beam size can be expressed as the sum of the square of each of the two contributions,  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { t o t } ^ { 2 } = \\sigma _ { s c r } ^ { 2 } + \\frac { \\beta \\varepsilon } { \\gamma } .\n$$ \n It is clear from the above equation that by measuring the electron beam sizes $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t o t } }$ for different electron beam energies $\\gamma _ { : }$ , one can reconstruct the screen resolution $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { s c r } }$ as well as the product of the emittance and beta function $\\beta \\varepsilon$ . This method is inspired by similar ones where certain beam or lattice parameters are varied to obtain the screen resolution.15–17,19,20 It is an implementation of the approach proposed in Ref. 17 for a location without dispersion.  \n III. RESULTS  \n We used the standard $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ beam and changed the electron beam energy at the end of the SwissFEL linac on the Aramis beamline from 3 to $6 \\ : \\mathrm { G e V }$ . The measurement of the performance of the new system was directly compared with that of the old setup with foils by putting both sets of filters in one optical box and using both for each electron beam energy setting. We recorded ten images for each electron beam energy and filter. The beam size for each image was obtained by fitting a Gaussian function to the image projection. We then fit Eq. (1) to the measured beam sizes to reconstruct the screen resolution and the product of emittance and beta function. Figure 3 shows the single-shot images for different settings. Figure 4 displays the vertical beam sizes averaged over ten shots and the calculated fits under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 4, the measured beam sizes are significantly larger with the foil filter when compared to the glass filter, indicating a worse screen resolution.  \n  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I. The evaluated product of the beta function and normalized emittance $( \\beta \\varepsilon )$ and the evaluated screen resolutions $( \\sigma _ { \\mathsf { s c r } } )$ for glass and foil filter measurement cases.

The new resolution of the glass filters was shown to be about $1 4 . 3 \\pm 0 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , while the foil filters had a resolution of about $1 9 . 8 \\pm 0 . 4 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The product of the emittance and the beta-function is, as e±xpected, within the error bars for both setups.  \n IV. DISCUSSION  \n The evaluated combined resolution of the screen and the optical setup matches the expected resolution of $1 4 \\mu \\mathrm m$ almost perfectly, with the deviation from the optical setup tested in the lab being well within the error bar of the fit for the curve. The performance of the glass filter is significantly better than that of the foil filter, which would improve the evaluation of such key parameters as slice emittance. The foil filter resolution is better than the ones reported for the same screen by Prat et al. $( 2 7 \\pm 7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p C } ;$ $2 9 \\pm 8 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { p C } )$ .16 This discrepancy can±be explained with focu±sing. The evaluation presented in Prat et al.16 used the DSCR as it was set up originally, where the optical box did not have the ability to re-focus. The experiment presented here used the best focusing for both the glass and foil ND filters, and it is likely that this focusing improved the resolution of the image through the foil filter by a few micrometers. This goes to show that the foil filters, despite their small width, still seem to have some small effect on the optical propagation path of the scintillated light and that a focusing scheme would help achieve a better resolution. The two measurements produce evaluations of the product of the beta function and normalized emittance that are within each other’s error bars. This evaluation also meets our expected values for the setup, which had an expected normalized emittance of $4 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ and a beta function between 5 and $1 0 \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n  \n V. CONCLUSION  \n The method presented in this article shows the ability to improve the screen resolution by using high-quality filters and dynamic focusing. The profile monitor resolution is reconstructed in a gentle way by measuring the electron beam sizes for different beam energies. Our results show a significant improvement of the beam size resolution (from 20 to $1 4 \\mu \\mathrm m \\dot { }$ ) with the new optical design. These improvements allow for regular evaluations of the resolution and the ability to set the focusing to different values to compensate for the change in optical properties of the setup, enabling a more reliable and consistent performance of the diagnostic for transverse beam profile measurements.  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n The authors would like to thank and acknowledge the work of the technical groups that maintain and operate SwissFEL.

Introduction  \n Over the past decades it has been the goal of both damping rings and synchrotron radiation (SR) sources to produce low vertical emittance beams. While damping rings are built with the specific purpose of achieving the smallest possible vertical emittance, the requirement for a SR source is less stringent, and is typically driven by the diffraction limit at its critical photon energy. At the Swiss Light Source (SLS) [1] this limit is approx. 18 pmrad. However, experimental stations with an interest in higher photon energies could benefit from an electron beam emittance that exceeds this limit. It is also of interest to establish the lowest vertical emittance that can be achieved from a SR source, such as the SLS, and to investigate its stability over a period of time. Vertical emittances of ${ \\sim } 5$ pmrad have so far been reported from SR sources [2–6], which is comparable to measurements and expectations from existing and planned damping rings [7,8].  \n  \n To enable an emittance measurement at a storage ring, whether it is a SR source or a damping ring, an image formation method is typically used for the determination of the beam size. These methods include imaging with a lens using visible SR [9,10], imaging via a pinhole using X-ray SR [11], imaging with a refractive metallic lens using X-ray SR [12], and imaging with zone plates using X-ray SR [13,14]. Beam sizes can also be determined by means of interference methods in the visible [15,16] and in the $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray [17] range, and by the so-called laser wire method [7,18]. The emittance determination thus relies on a beam size measurement and knowledge, through other means, of the beta and dispersion function values at the observation point. A determination of an rms beam size to below $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ by any of the above methods, if at all possible, requires a large instrumental and theoretical effort. Here, we present an additional method, ‘‘the $\\pi$ -polarization method’’, where images are formed from vertically polarized vis–UV SR [19,20], and demonstrates that this method is capable of determining beam sizes to well below $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n  \n A successful measurement of the beam size that uses an image formation method requires both a good optics scheme and a model for SR emission and focusing. A good optics scheme relaxes the demands on critical optical components, resulting in a near distortion-free image (except for inherent SR emission and diffraction effects). The emittance monitor beamline at the SLS comprises two optics schemes, the $\\pi$ -polarization and pinhole camera schemes. Both schemes eliminate the well-known problem of an excessive heat load on the first optical component. The SR emission, diffraction and focusing is fully treated within the electromagnetic theory of light. The electric fields at the first optical element are calculated using the retarded potentials of a relativistic moving charge [21,22]. The fields are then propagated, through lens and apertures, within the frame of scalar diffraction theory [23]. With this approach, diffraction and depth-of-field effects of SR are treated as a single phenomenon, closely related with the nature of SR. The Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW) code [24], used for our calculations, is based on this model.  \n Several factors related to the SLS are crucial to achieving a small emittance ratio. These include tight magnet alignment and roll tolerances due to a rigid mount on precision machined girders [25]; a reliable beam position monitor (BPM) system, providing a sub-micron position readout resolution [26], in combination with refined and frequently repeated beam-based offset corrections of BPM readings (giving absolute differences of a few microns between magnetic centres of quadrupoles adjacent to BPMs and beam position) [27,28]; a large number (73) of vertical BPMs and associated correctors, giving an average $4 3 ^ { \\circ }$ phase advance between BPMs; a fast orbit feedback system that effectively corrects beam distortions up to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ [29]; frequent beta function measurements and corrections by means of individual quadrupole power supplies, resulting in an rms deviation of $3 \\%$ and $10 \\%$ from the nominal vertical and horizontal values, respectively [28]; and thermal stability due to top-up operation $( < 0 . 4 \\%$ current variation). The final betatron coupling correction could be performed by weakly exciting just a few (6–8) skew quadrupoles in non-dispersive regions, as anticipated from studies of SLS imperfections [30]. These studies also lead to the prediction [31] that, at small insertion device (ID) gaps, a machine not properly corrected for betatron coupling, could exhibit a shorter Touschek lifetime than if corrected to a lower coupling value. This surprising effect was indeed observed during the initial coupling correction [32], and has also been reported elsewhere [33].  \n Table: Caption: Table 1 Nominal (no IDs) and measured parameter values at the observation point, together with derived emittances and emittance ratio  Maximum error margins are linearly added when deducing the maximum emittance and emittance ratio errors.

The pinhole camera scheme is still under development. Preliminary results have been presented elsewhere [4]. Here we place emphasis on the $\\pi$ –polarization method. The model for the SR emission and focusing is described in Section 3. In Section 4 we present measured data at SLS and compare it to the SRW predictions of a finite emittance beam. In Section 5 we perform the emittance determinations while estimating different error contributions. Finally in Section 6, we discuss whether the vertical emittance minimization is of local or global nature.  \n 2. The diagnostic beamline  \n The source point of the beamline is the centre of the middle-bending magnet in the SLS triple bend achromat lattice (see Table 1 for machine parameters). Fig. 1 shows a schematic top view of the beamline. The angular separation of the vis–UV branch and the $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray branch is 5 mrad, corresponding to an arc length of $3 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ .  \n  \n The branch used for the $\\pi$ -polarization method has a maximum clearance of $7 \\mathrm { { m r a d } _ { H } \\times 9 \\mathrm { { m r a d } _ { V } } }$ . The vis–UV light is twice directed through $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ angles due to space constraints. This arrangement is also of benefit for optical reasons as a partial polarization of the light is obtained from the substantial attenuation of the (horizontal) $\\sigma$ -polarization component. The first mirror is made of SiC, a material, which has an advantageous ratio of thermal conductivity to expansion (a factor 6 better than $\\mathrm { { C u ) } }$ . This allows for low current measurements $\\mathrm { \\Gamma } ( < 1 0 \\mathrm { m A } )$ , when the vertical gradient of the surface power density on the mirror is still moderate. At higher currents, however, the mirror must be protected from an excessive heat load that would otherwise result in its deformation. To achieve this, a horizontal ‘‘finger’’ absorber, of $4 \\mathrm { m m }$ height, has been inserted immediately before the mirror, while obstructing only the mid $\\pm 0 . 4 5$ mradV of the SR. This prevents $98 \\%$ of the $2 3 0 \\mathrm { W }$ power, at $4 0 0 \\mathrm { m A }$ current, reaching the mirror, while blocking only $1 \\%$ of the $\\pi$ -polarized spectral flux in the vis–UV range used for measurements. Cooling of the SiC mirror was not a viable option since mirror deformation would inevitably result from the large vertical temperature gradient. The second mirror is an angular movable aluminized fused silica (FS) mirror. Both mirrors have a surface flatness better than $3 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ peak to valley. A FS symmetric spherical lens is positioned $5 . 0 7 8 \\mathrm { m }$ from the source point, between the two mirrors. It has a surface accuracy of $4 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ peak to valley. The vis–UV light is guided out from within the vacuum region through a FS window at the end of the beamline, approx. $9 \\mathrm { m }$ from the source point. This serves to minimize the light footprint on the vacuum window, which, in the absence of optical window specifications, was deemed necessary in order to minimize the risk of wavefront distortions. Blades that determine the acceptance angle of the light are positioned in the locality of the lens. External to the vacuum, grey filters, narrow bandpass (BP) filters and a Glan–Taylor polarizer are all placed on remotely controlled rotational movers. These, together with a neighbouring Pointgrey FleaTM [34] CCD camera (pixel size $4 . 6 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ ), can also be remotely moved longitudinally in order to adjust for a new image plane when different BP filters are used. The camera roll error is less than 10 mrad. Since the filters and polarizer are situated close to the image plane, the specifications for their surface accuracies need not be the most stringent, and can duly be purchased from off-the-shelf optical component vendors. The magnifications in the vis–UV branch for the chosen wavelengths are $0 . 8 5 4 / 0 . 8 4 1 / 0 . 8 2 0$ at $\\lambda = 4 0 3 / 3 6 4 / 3 2 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ , respectively.  \n The horizontal acceptance angle of the X-ray branch is 0.8 mrad. The water cooled pinhole array, fabricated from a $1 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick tungsten sheet interspersed with $1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ diameter holes, is located $4 . 0 2 0 \\mathrm { m }$ from the source point. The light escaping these holes carries low power and can be released through a $2 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick non-cooled aluminium window. Monochromating molybdenum filters and phosphor $( 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick P43) are placed on a common optical table at the end of the beamline. The same type of camera as in the vis–UV branch is used to observe the phosphor via a zoom and focus adjustable lens system [35]. The magnification in the $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray branch, to the phosphor screen, is 1.276.  \n  \n 3. SR imaging model  \n The ideal goal would be to capture an exact image of the electron distribution in the transverse plane. However, certain features inherent to SR, such as a narrow vertical opening angle and radiation generation along the longitudinal electron trajectory, make this impossible. A more realistic scenario would be to form an image, which although affected by the afore-mentioned SR features, is nevertheless free from optical component aberrations. The transverse electron distribution could then be derived from a model that describes the image of a single electron, or ‘‘filament’’ beam. The acquired image is, to a good approximation, given by the convolution of the single electron image and the transverse electron distribution. Conversely, the transverse electron distribution is a deconvolution of the acquired image with the ‘‘filament’’ beam image. For stable beam conditions, the transverse electron distribution can be assumed to be a twodimensional Gaussian of unknown widths, which simplifies the de-convolution.  \n Hofmann and Me´ ot [36] describe diffraction effects from the SR spectral-angular distribution on the beam profile image formation in different cases of radiation by relativistic electrons. For the bending magnet SR case, a simple point source is assumed to emit an $E$ -field amplitude distribution over a vertical angle identical to the one given by Jackson [22], including the $\\pi$ phase shift between upper and lower lobes of the vertically polarized light. Horizontally, the $E$ -field amplitude distribution is assumed to be uniform, extending to a width defined by an aperture of $\\pm x _ { \\mathrm { c } }$ at the location of an ideal focusing lens. The full vertical SR distribution is accepted by the lens. In the case of small observation angles Hofmann and M ´eot arrive at the following $E _ { \\pi }$ -field (vertical $E$ -vector component) distribution in the image plane:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { E _ { \\pi } ( x , y ) = E _ { \\pi 0 } \\mathrm { s i n c } \\displaystyle \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi x _ { \\mathrm { c } } } { \\lambda p ^ { \\prime } } x \\right) } \\\\ { \\times \\displaystyle \\int _ { 0 } ^ { + \\infty } ( 1 + \\xi ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 1 / 2 } \\xi K _ { 1 / 3 } \\left( \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\frac { \\lambda _ { \\mathrm { c } } } { \\lambda } ( 1 + \\xi ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 3 / 2 } \\right) \\mathrm { s i n } \\left( \\frac { 2 \\pi p } { \\lambda \\gamma p ^ { \\prime } } y \\xi \\right) \\mathrm { d } \\xi } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $\\gamma = E / m _ { \\mathrm { e } } c ^ { 2 }$ , $E$ is the electron energy, $\\lambda$ is the observed radiation wavelength, $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { c } } = 4 \\pi R / 3 \\gamma ^ { 3 }$ is the critical wavelength, $R$ is the radius of the electron trajectory, $p$ and $p ^ { \\prime }$ are the distances from the source point to the lens and from the lens to the image plane, respectively, and $E _ { \\pi 0 }$ is a constant. Squaring Eq. (1) gives an intensity distribution in the image plane as shown in Fig. 2, where we have used numbers resembling our actual imaging scheme at SLS. This two-dimensional distribution function is of the form $f ( x ) g ( y )$ , where $f ( x ) = \\mathrm { s i n c } ^ { 2 } ( x )$ and $g ( y )$ is given by the square of the integral expression in Eq. (1).  \n  \n The model used to describe our $\\pi$ -polarization scheme was outlined by Chubar [37,38]. It is based on a near-field SR calculation at the first optical element, using the Fourier transform of the retarded scalar- and vector potentials [21], preserving all phase information as the electron moves along its trajectory. The integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchoff [23] is now applied to this Fourier transform (rather than the more usual spherical wave) at different apertures in the beamline. One benefit of this approach is that the model now includes, in a natural way, the so-called depth-of-field effect appearing in the image plane. Using Fourier optical methods, the SRW code, based on the described model, calculates the intensity distribution, $I ( x , y )$ , in the image plane. This distribution, resulting from a single relativistic electron, is termed the ‘‘filament-beam-spread function’’ (FBSF). It is equivalent to point-spread functions for optical systems in the case of virtual point sources. The intensity distribution is shown in Fig. 3, for the same SLS case as above, and is seen to no longer maintain the simple $f ( x ) g ( y )$ form. This is a consequence of the fact that the wavefront produced by the relativistic electron is more complicated than that of a point source [39].  \n A one-dimensional profile of the intensity distribution through the two maxima, $I ( x _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } , y )$ , gives a distribution of the vertically polarized focused light that displays a dual peak separated by a zero minimum at the centre, $I ( x _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } , 0 ) = 0$ . A vertical beam size may be determined even for the smallest of finite vertical beam sizes where the minimum of the acquired image significantly remains nonzero. While results presented in Section 4 demonstrate support for the Chubar model, it is worth noting that, with the present set-up at SLS, results to an accuracy of within $10 \\%$ may already be achieved through use of the approximate model [36], which uses the square of Eq. (1) as the FBSF.  \n For high current measurements a vertically thin ‘‘finger’’ absorber is inserted to block the intense mid-part of SR. It is incorporated into the model in Section 4. The vertical acceptance angle of 9.0 mrad, being slightly smaller than the total SR opening angles at the observed wavelengths, is also included in the model. However, these modifications only marginally affect the FBSF.  \n 4. Beam size measurements  \n All measurements presented are performed with $\\pi$ -polarized vis–UV range SR in $3 5 0 / 4 0 0 \\mathrm { m A }$ multi-bunch top-up operation mode corresponding to $0 . 8 6 / 0 . 9 8 \\mathrm { n C }$ per bunch (390 out of 480 buckets populated). Most measurements were performed during user operation with IDs at arbitrary positions/excitations (see Table 1 for machine parameters).  \n Fig. 4 shows the beam size measurement application displaying an acquired image by the $\\pi$ -polarization method. An IEEE-1394 Firewire camera [34], using a SonyTM $1 / 3 ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ CCD chip of $1 0 2 4 \\times 7 6 8$ pixels and 8 bit resolution writes image data directly to the EPICS control system. A region of interest selected from the application defines an EPICS sub-array record containing relevant data that can be retrieved at a faster rate than the complete image. In this way images can be updated and evaluated at rates of up to $1 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ . Filter configurations allowing exposure times of $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m s }$ are mostly chosen. Vibrations of the beam or the experimental setup with frequencies of less than approx. $2 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ thus will not enter into the result of the beam size measurement. However, higher frequency vibrations will make the beam size appear larger than it is. Special care is taken to adjust the noise level and to check the linearity of the camera, since these properties can change slightly over time. The rms vertical beam size, $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } }$ , is derived from the summation of the pixel intensities within the vertical narrow corridor. A pre-SRW-calculated table is then used to convert the valley-to-peak intensity ratio to a value for $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } }$ . The rms horizontal beam size, $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } }$ , is derived from integrating over the pixel intensities within the horizontal broad corridor, encapsulating the whole image.  \n The FWHM value is used for converting to $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } }$ . During measurements small beam ellipse rotations, originating either from betatron coupling or from a local vertical dispersion, are sometimes present. In this case, the vertically measured quantity is sey0 such that sey0osey, since only the vertical size of the central beam region is observed. This quantity will be termed the central rms vertical beam size. Horizontally the result is unaffected by a beam rotation, since the full image is used to obtain $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } }$ .  \n 4.1. Horizontal measurements  \n While it is more challenging to determine the beam size in the vertical plane, it is also of interest to verify that the model predictions agree with measurements in the horizontal plane, where the beam size is typically much larger. Fig. 5 shows a profile of the horizontal image in its entirety. The lines are profile predictions calculated from the SRW model by convoluting the FBSF of the vertically polarized light with a Gaussian electron beam and then integrating over the entire image, as is done with the on-line monitor. In this particular example $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } } = ( 5 7 . 0 \\pm 1 . 5 ) \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ is measured at the monitor. The error margins represent the maximum systematic errors. The statistical rms error is considerably smaller, $0 . 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for a single sample. Of particular note is the good agreement in the tails, which deviate from a Gaussian shape (dashed line). This is as anticipated since the predicted profile is a convolution of a Gaussian and a function of approximate form $\\operatorname { s i n c } ^ { 2 } ( x )$ .  \n To explore further the model predictions we measured horizontal image profiles — retaining the setup for vertically polarized light — for different horizontal apertures set by the blocking blades at the lens position. Fig. 6 shows the results, where we have plotted measured and predicted FWHM/2.355 of the images, against the inverse accepted horizontal SR opening angle. The solid line is the prediction from SRW, which is a convolution of an $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } } = 5 5 . 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Gaussian electron distribution and the calculated FBSF for the different opening angles. We have also indicated (dashed line) the result given from a convolution of the assumed electron beam distribution and a $\\mathrm { s i n c } ^ { 2 } ( x )$ distribution resulting from the simplified assumption of treating the filament beam as a far away point source (Fraunhofer diffraction case). For small acceptance angles the Fraunhofer approximation is correct, while for larger acceptance angles there is a clear discrepancy originating from the more complicated phase relations of the SR electric field emission over the arc, compared to a virtual point source. Even though it is a small effect at 5.9 mrad acceptance angle, we could still verify this experimentally with visible light $( 4 0 3 \\mathrm { n m } )$ . The effect is even more pronounced at shorter wavelengths. We also show the measured two-dimensional image (Fig. 7) at $\\lambda = 3 6 4 \\mathrm { n m }$ , and 5.9 mrad horizontal acceptance angle. Here we begin to see the predicted horizontal asymmetry (compare FBSF in Fig. 3; horizontal directions are reversed by the camera), even though it is heavily masked by the relatively large horizontal beam size.  \n 4.2. Vertical measurements  \n As an example of the vertical beam size measurement performed with vertically polarized light we present a profile (Fig. 8) obtained at $4 0 0 \\mathrm { m A }$ circulating current. This mode, using eight slightly tuned skew quadrupoles, all with integrated field strengths below $0 . 0 0 6 \\mathrm { { \\bar { m } } ^ { - 1 } }$ , gave a vertical rms beam size of $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } } = ( 6 . 4 \\pm 0 . 5 ) \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ at the monitor $( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } } = \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y 0 } }$ since no beam rotation could be detected). The error margins represent maximum systematic errors. The statistical rms error is considerably smaller, $0 . 0 8 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ for a single sample. Again, the SRW model gives a good prediction of the profile. However, the example also shows that we may be reaching the resolution limit of the method. The slightly raised intensity levels in the tails most probably originate from one or several non-ideal optics elements. Such a contribution in the intensity valley can therefore not be excluded. However, the SRW code has an option to include phase and/or amplitude errors of different elements. After including systematic phase errors of the lens, originating from its grinding (data provided by the vendor), the behaviour in the tails can also be understood. The primary (Seidel) aberrations of the lens are smaller by an order of magnitude. In case of this systematic grinding phase error, the zero minimum in the FBSF is still preserved, and valley-to-peak ratios for finite beam sizes remain essentially unaltered.  \n  \n The sensitivity of the valley-to-peak intensity ratio at small vertical beam sizes can be slightly increased by either blocking a large part of the central SR or detecting at shorter wavelengths. Both methods bring the peaks of the FBSF closer together. We prefer the latter method, since it preserves the possibility to cross-check the optics quality from behaviour of the tails. In the former case, one is essentially moving towards a pure interferometer [15] method, where tails and possible beam rotations are being obscured by a growing fringe pattern. Hence, to further verify the small beam size measurements, additional measurements at two different wavelengths were undertaken. BP and grey filters were exchanged and the image plane was re-adjusted. Fig. 9 shows the predicted valley-topeak intensity ratios as functions of central vertical rms beam size at wavelengths of 325, 364 and $4 0 3 \\mathrm { n m }$ . For four different skew quadrupole settings the measured ratio at each wavelength has been superimposed onto the predicted curve. Error margins represent estimated maximum systematic errors from fitting and wavefront distortions. A $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y 0 } }$ value and its error margins are given by a reading on the abscissa. There is agreement within the error margins, except for the $4 0 3 \\mathrm { n m }$ values at small vertical beam sizes. The explanation is that our $4 0 3 \\mathrm { n m }$ band pass filter had a broader transmission band (approx. $3 \\mathrm { n m }$ instead of $1 . 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ at FWHM). This illustrates the need for very narrow band pass filters if small vertical beam sizes are to be determined. The fact that the results agree well at 325 and $3 6 4 \\mathrm { n m }$ for the smallest vertical beam size, supports the conclusion that the optics quality is not limiting the resolution.  \n  \n 5. Emittance determination  \n The stability of the SLS as given by the vertical beam size is illustrated in Fig. 10, which shows archived data over a period of 4.5 days dedicated to user operation and for which changes to the ID parameters by experimenters are the norm. However, the beam had been deliberately tuned (last tuning at (a)) towards a small vertical beam size, and minimal beam rotation $\\phantom { + } < 1 5 \\mathrm { m r a d } )$ , using eight skew quadrupoles, all with integrated field strengths below $\\bar { 0 . 0 0 6 } \\mathrm { { m } } ^ { - 1 }$ . This still gave an acceptable lifetime of approx. $5 \\mathrm { h }$ . The circulating current was $4 0 0 . 7 { \\pm } 0 . 7 \\mathrm { m A }$ over the whole period. The upper data (right scale) shows the central rms vertical beam size. An average central rms vertical beam size of $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y 0 } } = 6 . 8 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ was sustained over a period of more than 3 days, with the exception of a few hours (b), due to one undulator gap change. The horizontal beam size (lower data line, left scale) varies slightly more. During a nine-hour period (c), a wiggler gap was opened. All other stepwise variations of $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } }$ are due to undulator gap changes. For emittance and emittance ratio determinations we will use the average value $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } } = 5 7 . 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ measured over the whole time period.  \n  \n Table 1 summarizes the emittance determinations. Measured values for the machine functions and for the rms beam sizes are presented. From the estimated maximum error in the measurement we give maximum error margins for the different quantities. The beam relative energy spread, $\\sigma _ { \\delta }$ , is the only quantity not to be measured. However, an energy spread deviation from the natural one can be probed, and most likely excluded, since while modulating the RF levels in the Higher Harmonic Cavities [40], no effect was seen on the horizontal beam size. Still, we estimate a maximum value of $10 \\%$ increase due to possible RF noise. The dispersion values can be measured, assuming a known momentum compaction, by the camera with a $0 . 2 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ precision error. We use the $2 \\sigma$ values as an estimate of the maximum deviations. The influence on the dispersion of the momentum compaction uncertainty (maximum $2 \\%$ ) is $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ horizontally and $0 . 0 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ vertically. In comparison to the measured $\\eta _ { y } = 2 . 3 \\ : \\mathrm { m m }$ , spurious vertical dispersion is also measured at all BPMs, resulting in an rms value of $3 . 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ . The beta function values cannot be measured at the source point but only in the adjacent quadrupoles. We perform an entire measurement of the (average) beta functions in all 177 quadrupoles and use this to fit the model beta functions. From this we get the values at the observation point. The precision of the horizontal and vertical beta function value measurements are $1 \\%$ and $0 . 5 \\%$ , respectively. The $2 \\sigma$ values are used as an estimate of the maximum model deviation from the actual value at the observation point. The maximum deviations in the beam size values are estimated from systematic profile fitting errors and errors due to possible optics wavefront distortions.  \n  \n The emittances are deduced according to  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { x } = ( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } } ^ { 2 } - ( \\sigma _ { \\delta } \\eta _ { x } ) ^ { 2 } ) / \\beta _ { x }\n$$ \n and  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { y } = ( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y 0 } } ^ { 2 } - ( \\sigma _ { \\delta } \\eta _ { y } ) ^ { 2 } ( 1 - ( \\sigma _ { \\delta } \\eta _ { x } / \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } } ) ^ { 2 } ) ) / \\beta _ { y } .\n$$ \n In the presence of horizontal and vertical dispersion, $\\eta _ { x }$ and $\\eta _ { y }$ , the beam ellipse in the $( x , y )$ plane is not only widened but also rotated by an angle, W, given by  \n $$\n1 2 \\vartheta = 2 \\eta _ { x } \\eta _ { y } \\sigma _ { \\delta } ^ { 2 } \\Big / ( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } } ^ { 2 } - \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } } ^ { 2 } ) ,\n$$ \n since the dispersive contributions to the particle distribution are of course correlated horizontally and vertically. Since the vertical beam size, $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y 0 } }$ , is obtained from integration over a narrow corridor (width $\\leqslant \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } }$ , see Fig. 4) the correction factor in Eq. (3) has to be applied to correctly de-convolute the dispersive contribution from the emittance contribution. In our case, however, the dispersive contribution is rather small, resulting in a rotation angle of only $\\vartheta = 1 4$ mrad of the beam ellipse, which is barely detectable with our experimental set-up (the corresponding vertical rms beam size is $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } } = 6 . 8 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\approx \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y 0 } } )$ . In the horizontal, the full image is used to obtain $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e x } }$ and the simple de-convolution of Eq. (2) can be applied. In conclusion, we state that the vertical rms emittance at the observation point is $\\varepsilon _ { y } = ( 3 . 2 \\pm 0 . 7 )$ pmrad, where the error margins represent linearly added maximum systematic errors of measured quantities. Correspondingly, the emittance ratio, $g$ , is determined to be $g = ( 0 . 0 5 { \\pm } 0 . 0 2 ) \\%$ . With no skew quadrupoles excited, the vertical rms emittance is larger by a factor of 2.  \n 6. Discussion  \n So far we have tacitly assumed that the concept of horizontal and vertical emittance of a particle beam is valid. In the case of uncoupled motion, $\\mathit { \\varepsilon } _ { \\mathit { \\varepsilon } _ { x } }$ and $\\varepsilon _ { y }$ are defined as the two transverse rms phase space areas divided by $\\pi$ . In reality, there is always a coupled motion between the transverse phase space planes due to magnet misalignments. In this case, let $\\varepsilon _ { x }$ and $\\varepsilon _ { y }$ be the projections of the four-dimensional rms phase space volume onto the twodimensional horizontal and vertical phase spaces [41]. With this definition $\\varepsilon _ { x }$ and $\\varepsilon _ { y }$ are synonymous to the measured quantities. However, they are not invariants, but vary with the longitudinal coordinate, $s$ . Three equilibrium invariants, the normal mode emittances [42], $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I } } , \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ and $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I I } }$ , may be calculated in the fully coupled case for an electron storage ring. Assuming only transverse coupling, $\\varepsilon _ { x } ( \\mathrm { s } )$ and $\\varepsilon _ { y } ( \\mathrm { s } )$ will approach $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I } }$ and $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ , respectively, as we move towards a perfectly aligned machine. In the limit the (invariant) vertical emittance still has a finite value, set by the fundamental quantum nature of SR emission, which for SLS is $\\varepsilon _ { y } = 0 . 5 5$ pmrad.  \n  \n We now address the question as to whether the small vertical emittance achieved when performing the skew quadruple betatron coupling correction, is of a global or local nature. One could argue that the minimization of the vertical beam size at one observation point in the ring does not necessarily constitute evidence for a minimal vertical emittance throughout the entire ring. Indeed, the inverse effect could also be true.  \n  \n In Ref. [30] an imperfect SLS machine was modelled by the 6D code TRACY [43], and betatron coupling correction was simulated by using six skew quadrupoles in nondipersive regions, for 200 distorted machine lattices (seeds). The minimisation was performed on $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ , since this is the relevant quantity — though not easily measured — to evaluate the success of the correction. A minimization of $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ assures, for this skew quadrupole scheme, a minimization of the average vertical emittance around the ring, $\\langle \\varepsilon _ { y } ( \\mathsf { s } ) \\rangle _ { \\mathsf { s } }$ , as well. We repeated the same procedure for 100 seeds with the only exception that the minimization was now performed on the vertical beam size at the position of our monitor. As can be seen from Fig. 11a, $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ , can also be minimized in this way. The quantity, $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } } ^ { 2 } / \\beta _ { y }$ , in Fig. 11a is not the local vertical emittance, since $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } }$ includes the local spurious vertical dispersion. This explains the lower than unity slope $( a = 0 . 7 6 )$ ) of the correlation of $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ vs. $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { e y } } ^ { 2 } / \\beta _ { y }$ . In fact, when minimizing on the beam size at the monitor we get on average for the 100 seeds, $\\langle \\varepsilon _ { y } ( \\mathrm { s } _ { \\mathrm { m o n } } ) \\rangle = 1 . 0 2 \\langle \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } } \\rangle$ . Furthermore, Fig. 11b shows that essentially the same $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ is reached for the two minimization processes, since all corrected seeds are clustered along the diagonal $( a = 1 )$ ) line. In conclusion, all three quantities $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { I I } }$ , $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { y } } ( \\mathrm { s } _ { \\mathrm { m o n } } )$ and $\\langle \\varepsilon _ { y } ( \\mathsf { s } ) \\rangle _ { \\mathsf { s } }$ are minimized by minimizing the vertical beam size at the monitor.  \n A larger number of skew quads in the storage ring, would increase the risk of building up local coupling bumps when applying this straightforward, empirical method of minimization. Other methods, such as measurements of the fully coupled response matrix and the SVDbased minimization of the off-diagonal elements using all skew quads, would therefore have to be applied to assure a global minimization.  \n 7. Conclusions  \n We have described a method using vertically polarized SR in the visible to ultra-violet range, capable of determining vertical rms beam sizes below $7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The SLS can operate in standard user $4 0 0 \\mathrm { m A }$ multi-bunch $( 0 . 9 8 { \\mathrm { n C } } /$ bunch) top-up mode over several days providing a vertical rms emittance of $\\varepsilon _ { y } = ( 3 . 2 \\pm 0 . 7 )$ pmrad, or an emittance ratio of $g = ( 0 . 0 5 \\pm 0 . 0 2 ) \\%$ . It was also shown that the achieved vertical emittance is not due to a local minimization, but rather a global one.  \n "

Penco Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste, 34149 Basovizza, Trieste, Italy (Received 23 March 2016; published 16 September 2016)  \n SwissFEL is a x-rays free electron laser (FEL) driven by a $5 . 8 \\mathrm { \\ G e V }$ linac under construction at Paul Scherrer Institut. In SwissFEL, wire scanners (WSCs) will be complementary to view-screens for emittance measurements and routinely used to monitor the transverse profile of the electron beam during FEL operations. The SwissFEL WSC is composed of an in-vacuum beam-probe—motorized by a stepper motor—and an out-vacuum pick-up of the wire signal. The mechanical stability of the WSC in-vacuum hardware has been characterized on a test bench. In particular, the motor induced vibrations of the wire have been measured and mapped for different motor speeds. Electron-beam tests of the entire WSC setup together with different wire materials have been carried out at the $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { M e V }$ SwissFEL Injector Test Facility (SITF, Paul Scherrer Institut, CH) and at FERMI (Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste, Italy). In particular, a comparative study of the relative measurement accuracy and the radiation-dose release of Al 99 ∶Si 1 and tungsten (W) wires has been carried out. On the basis of the outcome of the bench and electron-beam tests, the SwissFEL WSC can be qualified as a high resolution and machine-saving diagnostic tool in consideration of the mechanical stability of the scanning wire at the micrometer level and the choice of the wire material ensuring a drastic reduction of the radiation-dose release with respect to conventional metallic wires. The main aspects of the design, laboratory characterization and electron beam tests of the SwissFEL WSCs are presented.  \n DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.19.092802  \n I. INTRODUCTION  \n SwissFEL will provide coherent $\\mathbf { X }$ -rays light in the wavelength region $7 - 0 . 7 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ and $0 . 7 - 0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ [1]. Electron bunches with charge of $2 0 0 / 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ and transverse normalized slice emittance of $0 . 4 / 0 . 2 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ mrad will be emitted by a S-band photocathode gun at a repetition rate of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ according to a two-bunches structure with a temporal separation of $2 8 ~ \\mathrm { n s }$ . The electron beam will be then accelerated up to $3 3 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ by a S-band rf booster and, finally, to $5 . 8 \\mathrm { G e V }$ by a C-band rf linac. Thanks to an offcrest acceleration in the rf booster, the electron beam will experience a longitudinal compression in two magnetic chicanes from an initial bunch length of $3 / 1$ ps (rms) down to $2 0 / 3$ fs (rms). Two X-band rf cavities will compensate the quadratic distortion of the longitudinal phase space due to the off-crest acceleration of the beam and the nonlinear contribution of the magnetic dispersion [2]. In the booster section, a laser-heater will smooth down possible microstructures affecting the longitudinal profile of the beam [3,4]. Finally, thanks to a rf kicker—placed after the second bunch-compressor—and a magnetic switch-yard, the second electron bunch of the beam train will be shifted from the main beam line to a secondary one so that the SwissFEL linac, after a further acceleration stage of the two bunches, will supply two distinct undulator chains at a repetition rate of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ : the hard x-rays line Aramis and the soft $\\mathbf { X }$ -rays line Athos [1].  \n  \n In a FEL (free electron laser) driver linac, wire scanners (WSCs) are currently used to monitor the transverse profile of the electron beam [5–13] when the view-screen imaging of the beam is hampered by coherent radiation emission due to microbunching. In SwissFEL, WSCs will be complementary to view-screens for emittance measurements and, thanks to the barely invasive feature, also used for routine monitoring of the transverse profile of the electron beam during FEL operations. Moreover, the beam imaging at SwissFEL being performed by means of YAG: Ce screens [14], only WSCs will be able to discriminate the profile of each single bunch in two-bunches operations. In SwissFEL, the WSC in-vacuum hardware consists of a planar wire fork which can be inserted $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ with respect to the vertical direction into the vacuum chamber by means of a Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) linear-stage driven by a stepper motor, see Fig. 1. The wire-fork is designed to be equipped with two wire triplets, the spare triplet being possibly composed of wires of different material and/or diameter. Each wire of the triplet will separately scan the beam profile along a given direction: the vertical wire (X-scanning, horizontal-scanning), the horizontal wire (Y-scanning, vertical-scanning) and the diagonal wire (XYcoupling). During a WSC measurement, the single wire scanning the beam at a constant speed produces—at every rf shot—a shower of primary scattered electrons and secondary emitted particles in proportion to the fraction of the beam sampled by the wire. In SwissFEL, the forward —high energy and small scattering angle—component of the particle shower (wire signal) will be out-vacuum detected by means of beam loss monitors (BLMs). The beam-loss sensitive material of the SwissFEL BLMs is a scintillator fiber (Saint Gobain BCF-20, decay time 2.7 ns) wrapped around the vacuum pipe. The scintillator fiber is matched by means of a plastic optical fiber (POF) to a photomultiplier (PMT) having a remotely adjustable gain in the range $5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 3 } - 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ . The PMT signal is finally digitized and integrated in time by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) unit. The SwissFEL BLMs are designed to detect the wire signal from $1 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ bunches and to have a sufficient time-response to discriminate the 28 ns time structure of the SwissFEL beam in two-bunches operations [15]. In SwissFEL, the wire-scanned profile of the electron beam will be reconstructed thanks to the beam-synchronous acquisition (BSDAQ) of the encoder read-out of the wire-position and of the signal read-out of the BLM at every rf shot. Furthermore, thanks to the BSDAQ readout of the beam charge and the transverse position of the beam centroid provided by beam position monitors (BPMs) [16] placed immediately downstream and upstream the WSC, possible errors due to the beam jitter can be corrected in the reconstructed beam profile.  \n  \n  \n In the present work, technical details on the design of the SwissFEL WSCs will be presented as well as the main results of the bench and electron-beam tests of the entire WSC setup. Laboratory tests aimed at determining the mechanical stability of the in-vacuum hardware of the WSC and, in particular, the stepper-motor induced vibration of the wire in the speed range of interest of SwissFEL were carried out. e-beam tests of a prototype of the SwissFEL WSC—in-vacuum and out-vacuum components—were performed: (1) at low charge and energy— $1 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ and $2 5 0 { \\mathrm { ~ M e V } }$ —at SITF [17] and (2) at high charge and energy— ${ } ^ { 7 0 0 } \\ \\mathrm { p C }$ and $1 . 5 \\mathrm { \\ G e V } .$ —at FERMI [18,19]. Thanks to the e-beam tests, the issue of the necessary detection sensitivity and dynamics of the SwissFEL BLM in the beam charge range $1 0 { - } 2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ was clarified as well as the issue of the optimum distance of the BLM from the WSC as a function of the beam energy. The question of the choice of the most suitable wire solution (material and diameter) was also positively defined thanks to the e-beam tests. The robustness of wires of different materials and diameters was tested on electron beams. The relative measurement accuracy and the radiation-dose release along the machine during a WSC measurement was also determined for different wire solutions. In particular, a comparative study of the scanning performances—relative measurement accuracy and radiation-dose release—of a $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\operatorname { \\cdot S i } } ( 1 )$ wire with a diameter of $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and a tungsten (W) wire with a diameter of $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ was carried out at FERMI at a beam energy of $1 . 3 2 5 { \\mathrm { ~ G e V } }$ and at a charge of $7 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ .  \n II. DESIGN OF THE SWISSFEL WIRE SCANNERS  \n In SwissFEL, view screens and WSCs will be used to monitor the transverse profile of electron beams with a size varying between $5 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ and $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (rms) along the entire machine. The fork of the SwissFEL WSC—see Fig. 2—can be equipped with a main triplet of metallic wires and a second spare triplet of wires. Each metallic wire can be fixed between two pins and suitably stretched by means of a metallic spring. Thanks to a system of multiple pin slots, three different distances (8,5.5 and $3 \\mathrm { m m }$ ) between the wirevertex of each triplet and the center of the beam pipe can be set and, consequently—for a given motor speed—three different time intervals can be suitably chosen to perform the sequential scanning of the three beam projections.  \n In the design of the SwissFEL WSCs, particular care was devoted to the choice of the wire material. Several wires of different material and diameter were indeed tested on the electron beam at SITF and FERMI. The special design of the SwissFEL wire-fork with the possibility to be equipped with two distinct triplets of wires offered the unique opportunity to make simultaneous comparative tests of different wires as described in the following. In SwissFEL, wire scanners will be used to measure the beam emittance by means of a quadrupole scan—an operation normally carried out under undulator protection from the radiation damage due to an unmatched beam transport—as well as to routinely monitor the transverse size of the beam under FEL operations. In the latter WSC application, the radiation-dose release along the machine can be detrimental to critical components of the machine such as the undulators. For such a reason, the choice of wire material and diameter for the SwissFEL WSCs was the object of a careful investigation. The search for the optimum wire solution was not only driven by the constraint to reduce as much as possible the diameter (D) of the wire— $\\mathbf { \\mathcal { D } } / 4$ being the rms size of the wire defines indeed the rms geometrical resolution in a WSC measurement [20]—but also by the constraint to choose a material with the lowest density $( \\rho )$ and atomic number $( Z )$ . In fact, the radiation energy losses $\\Delta E$ of a high energy electron beam with energy $E$ scale down with $\\rho$ , $Z$ and the thickness $\\Delta x$ of the material according to the formula  \n  \n $$\n\\frac { \\Delta E } { \\Delta x } = \\frac { E } { L _ { R } } ,\n$$ \n where $L _ { R }$ is the radiation length of the material with $1 / L _ { R }$ depending quadratically on $Z$ and linearly on $\\rho$ [21]. Further aspects being considered in the choice of the wire material were: (1) the breaking risk of the wire due to anomalous vibrations of the wire-fork and (2) the sensitivity of the wire to low-frequency vibrations induced by the stepper motor. In SwissFEL the wire-fork is indeed motorized by a 2-phase stepper motor which may excite possible low frequency vibration eigenmodes of the wire. According to the experience of several FEL and x-ray facilities such as FLASH and LCLS [9,10,12,13,22], carbon wires are normally preferred to tungsten wires wherever the risk of radiation damage can be a critical issue and/or whenever accuracy and precision are not relevant to a WSC measurement (WSC as a beam-finder). On the other hand, carbon wires are quite rigid and fragile and thus more susceptible than metallic wires to a breaking risk because of an anomalous vibration of the wire-fork. Moreover, contrary to metallic wires, carbon wires can be only fixed and barely stretched onto a wire-fork. Consequently, the risk of exciting an eigenmode oscillation frequency of the wire because of a resonance with a stepper-motor induced vibration of the wire-fork at low frequency is much higher for a carbon wire than for a metallic wire. Such a risk can be avoided or, at least, mitigated when a sufficiently high mechanical tension is applied to the metallic wire fixed between the two pins so that the eigenmode oscillation frequency of the wire can be shifted toward the high frequency region. The option of stretching the wire is available in the wire-fork of the SwissFEL WSCs which is suitably provided with a metallic spring for each wire. Taking into account the aforementioned issues, metallic wires were preferred to carbon wires for the SwissFEL WSC. In a FEL facility [9,10,13], tungsten wires are typically used for a WSC. Tungsten wires show indeed exceptional properties from the point of view of the beam robustness (melting point, about $3 4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ and the mechanical strength (tensile strength, about $1 9 0 0 \\mathrm { M P a } ,$ ). Tungsten wires as well as carbon wires [23] are commercially available with a very small diameter— $. 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire can be easily found on the market—hence ensuring a high geometrical resolution in a measurement. Moreover, tungsten being characterized by a high values of the density and the atomic number, the reconstruction of a beam transverse profile scanned by a tungsten wire can benefit from a very high signal-to-noise ratio. On the other hand, the high release of radiation-dose along the machine is also the main drawback of using tungsten wires. For such a reason, the possibility to use for the SwissFEL WSC—as an alternative to tungsten—a different metallic wire was investigated keeping in mind the constraint to reduce as much as possible the release of the radiation-dose along the machine during a WSC measurement. For such a purpose, wires of an aluminium alloy—Al 99 ∶Si 1 —were selected as a possible solution and tested on the electron beam. Compared to a pure aluminium, the $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\mathrel { : } } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ is characterized by a similar melting point (about $6 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ ) but a higher tensile strength (about $3 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M P a } ,$ ) which is beneficial to the mechanical strength and the elasticity of the wire. Furthermore, compared to tungsten, $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\mathrel { : } } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ has a much lower density and atomic number, hence ensuring a reduction of the radiation-dose release. Electron beam tests of $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\mathrel { : } } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ wires with a diameter of $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ have been successfully carried out at FERMI at a beam energy of $1 . 3 2 5 \\mathrm { ~ G e V }$ and charge of $7 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ . Comparative results of the scanning performances—measurement accuracy of the beam size and collected radiation-dose at the FERMI undulator chain—of a $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Al 99 ∶Si 1 wire against a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ W wire are reported in Sec. II C.  \n  \n  \n A. Test-bench characterization of the SwissFEL WSCs  \n The reliability of a WSC measurement of the beam profile depends on the measurement accuracy of the relative position of the wire at each machine trigger event [24–26]. For such a purpose, the readout of both the encoder wire-position and the BLM signals will be acquired in SwissFEL according to a BSDAQ mode as well as the readout of adjacent BPMs to correct the measurement by possible errors due to the transverse jitter of the electron beam. The encoder readout of the wire position can be considered reliably provided that the wire vibration during the scan is negligible, i.e., stays within the tolerance limit defined by the geometrical resolution of the scanning wire. The constraint of the mechanical stability was one of the main issues in designing and prototyping the in-vacuum hardware of the SwissFEL WSCs. In particular, the determination of the wire vibration under motion of the UHV linear stage of the SwissFEL WSC was the object of several campaigns of measurements as already documented in [25,26]. In the present work, the results of wire-vibration measurements recently carried out—Summer 2015—on the last and definitive prototype of the UHV linear stage of the SwissFEL WSC will be reported. The UHV linear stage of the SwissFEL WSC—equipped with an incremental optical encoder, end-switches and a homing sensor—is motorized by a 2-phase stepper motor and remotely driven by a motor controller. The coupling of the motor with the wire-fork holder is ensured by a spindle equipped with a ball-screw and a gear-box with a conversion ratio 1∶25 (1 spindle revolution corresponds to 25 motor turns and to a lead screw-pitch of $6 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ ). The mechanics of the UHV linear stage has been suitably dimensioned to minimize the motor induced wire-vibration and to guarantee a reliable wire-fork motion from the lowest speed limit of $0 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ up to $3 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ that is the maximum speed of interest of WSC measurements in SwissFEL.  \n The mechanical stability of the SwissFEL WSC—in particular, the wire stability under stepper motor motion— was characterized by setting up in vacuum—at about $2 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 7 }$ mbar—a complete prototype of the system on a SwissFEL girder, see Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, it is possible to recognize the vacuum chamber—mounted on the girder— and the motorized UHV linear-stage which inserts—at $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ into the vacuum chamber—a cylindrical holder with the wire-fork attached, see also Fig. 1. In Fig. 3, it is also possible to recognize a fast camera that is used to image the moving wire. The possible oscillation of the wire is the result of the propagation of the stepper motor induced vibration along the wire-fork and the relative arm. Taking into account the $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ orientation of the wire-fork axis, the horizontal wire mounted at the very bottom of the fork— Fig. 1—is the most critical and sensitive to possible stepper motor induced vibrations. The experimental results shown in Fig. 4 describe indeed the stability features of the horizontal wire mounted at the very bottom of the wirefork, see Fig. 1. Tungsten (W) wires with a diameter of $2 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ were mounted on the wire-fork and stretched with a sufficient tension to avoid oscillation eigenmodes at a frequency below $1 \\ \\mathrm { k H z }$ . Measurements of the wire vibrations induced by the stepper motor were performed by imaging the wire—back-illuminated in the vacuum chamber by a lamp—by means of a sCMOS camera equipped with a $2 0 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ lens. The motor of the wire-fork was driven in the speed range $0 . 1 { - } 6 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ . Thanks to a suitable adjustment of the camera ROI (region-of-interest), the camera frame-rate was set to about 565 fps (camera exposure time $1 ~ \\mathrm { m s } )$ ). With a distance between wire and camera ensuring a pixel resolution at the image plane of about $7 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , the measurement precision of the imaging setup of the wire position was estimated in $0 . 9 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (rms) as resulting from the determination of the centroid position of the wire at rest. Thanks to such a measurement precision, it was possible to observe and characterize vibrations of the wire centroid with an accuracy better than the tolerance limit of $1 . 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ which is the rms geometrical resolution achievable in a WSC measurement by a wire with a diameter of $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The outcome of this measurement campaign of the wire motion confirmed that the vibration of the wire centroid largely remains within a tolerance limit of $1 . 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (rms) in the motor-speed range $0 . 1 { - } 3 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ with the exception of a small velocity range $0 . 5 { - } 0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ where an anomalous wire vibration of $2 . 1 \\mathrm { - } 1 . 6 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ slightly exceeding the tolerance limit was observed, see Fig. 4. Meanwhile, the measured diameter (rms) of the moving wire was observed not to vary appreciably with respect to the wire at rest so indicating that the wire does not vibrate at a frequency higher than the characteristic acquisition frequency of the camera (565 fps). In conclusion, taking into account that the motor-speed range of interest of SwissFEL is $0 . 1 { - } 0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ at a repetition rate of $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ and $1 . 0 { - } 3 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ at a repetition rate of $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\ H z } -$ corresponding in both cases to a wire-step of $7 . 1 - 2 1 . 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ per rf shot—the slightly anomalous resonant vibration of the wire observed in the motor-speed range $0 . 5 { - } 0 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ is definitely not detrimental to a WSC measurement in SwissFEL.  \n  \n As a further and final comment on the measured wirevibrations plotted in Fig. 4, the spectral analysis of the measured data of the wire vibrations vs time for different motor speeds was observed to show an amplitude peak at a characteristic frequency of about $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ . An amplitude peak at the same frequency results from the spectral analysis of the measurement vs time of the centroid position of the wire at rest. Consequently, the hypothesis that the wire be affected by a real oscillation mode at this characteristic frequency can be excluded. The observation of this characteristic frequency in the measured data can be interpreted as a spurious effect due either to an environment induced vibration of the entire experimental setup (WSC in-vacuum hardware and camera setup) or to a characteristic vibration of the imaging setup (camera vibration induced by the internal cooling system, time-fluctuation of the light intensity of the lamp joined to a nonhomogeneous spatial distribution of the light over the camera field of view).  \n B. e-beam tests of the SwissFEL WSCs at SITF  \n Several WSC tests were carried out at SITF [17] until Fall 2014 when the decommissioning of the test facility started. The experimental activity at SITF dealt with: comparison—WSC against view-screen—of beam transverse profile measurements; beam resistance tests of tungsten wires of different diameters; determination of the optimum distance between WSC and BLM at a beam energy of a few hundred MeV; study of the BLM sensitivity and detection dynamics in the beam charge range $1 0 -$ $2 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ and of the detector capability to discriminate the 28 ns time-structure in two-bunches operations.  \n  \n The very first prototype of the WSC installed at SITF was composed of a wire-fork extension integrated in the view-screen holder, see Fig. 5. The insertion axis of this WSC prototype being vertical, only the horizontal wire was used for a direct measurement of the vertical profile of the electron beam. At the early stage of the beam operations at SITF, BLMs were not available. Consequently, the detection of the wire-signal during a WSC measurement was obtained as the differential charge read-out of a first BPM placed upstream the WSC and of a second BPM placed downstream the WSC in the arm of the high energy spectrometer of the linac. Since a portion of the wiresignal (primary scattered electrons and secondary emitted electrons) does not match the energy acceptance of the high energy spectrometer, a differential measurement of the charge readout of the two aforementioned BPMs provides a relative measurement of the fraction of the beam charge intercepted by the wire at each rf shot. The BSDAQ at $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ of the charge readout of the two BPMs and of the encoder readout of the wire position during a wire-scan allowed the vertical profile of the electron beam to be reconstructed. Measurements of the vertical profile of the electron beam with a size in the range $0 . 1 \\mathrm { - } 0 . 9 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ (rms) were carried out at SITF [26] by means of an OTR screen and a coaxial WSC at a beam charge of $1 6 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ and energy of $2 3 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ as shown Fig. 6. According to a linear fit of the experimental data plotted in Fig. 6, the relative measurement accuracy of a WSC against an OTR screen stays within $2 \\%$ in the vertical beam size range $0 . 1 \\mathrm { - } 0 . 9 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ .  \n  \n Other issues to be clarified to complete the design of the SwissFEL WSC dealt with: (1) the feasibility of the outvacuum detection of the forward component of the particle shower produced in a WSC measurement; (2) the determination of the optimum distance between WSC and BLM as a function of the beam energy; (3) the sensitivity of the SwissFEL BLM in detecting a wire-signal from a $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ bunch.  \n Numerical simulations of the angular and energy distribution of the particle shower produced by an electron beam intercepting a tungsten wire with a diameter of 13 and $2 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ were performed by means of the Monte Carlo code FLUKA [26–28]. The electron beam was modeled as a pencil beam (no energy spread) with energy 0.340, 1.330, 2.990 and $5 . 2 0 0 \\mathrm { G e V }$ traveling along the symmetry axis of the vacuum chamber. According to the results of the simulations, primary and secondary electrons mainly compose the particle shower which, for a fraction of about $9 5 \\%$ , is forward emitted with a uniform energy distribution within a polar angle of $\\pi / 1 6$ rad with respect to the beam axis, see Figs. 7 and 8. In conclusion, based on a very simplified model of the machine which does not include any magnetic shaping and rf transport of the wirescattered beam, FLUKA simulations predict that about $9 5 \\%$ of the wire-signal intercepts a CF16 vacuum-pipe—inner and outer diameter 16 and $1 8 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , respectively—at a distance from the wire roughly between 0.1 and $4 . 0 \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n  \n A first experimental check of this numerical prediction of the optimum distance WSC-BLM was carried out at SITF. For such a purpose, a BLM monitor was installed at the very end of SITF just in front of the dipole of the high energy spectrometer. After setting a full charge transport of the electron beam—energy $2 4 5 \\mathrm { M e V }$ and charge $1 8 0 \\mathrm { p C - }$ up to the beam dump of SITF, the electron beam was then alternatively fully intercepted by means of the single OTR screens ${ \\mathrm { 0 . 1 ~ } } \\mu { \\mathrm { m } }$ Al coating on a $3 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ thick Si wafer)— see Fig. 5—which were available along the beam line. Meanwhile, at each OTR screen insertion, the corresponding BLM readout was recorded as shown in Fig. 9 where the BLM readout vs distance from the inserted OTR screen is plotted. According to a rule-of-thumb extrapolation— based on Eq. (1)—from the data shown in Fig. (9), for a WSC equipped with $5 { \\mathrm { - } } 1 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wires, a maximum of the BLM signal can be expected at a distance from the WSC of about $2 . 5 { - } 3 \\mathrm { m }$ at a beam energy of about $2 5 0 \\mathrm { M e V } .$ This result being in agreement with the simulation prediction [28] of the optimum distance WSC-BLM also complies with the outcome of analogous measurements previously carried out at SITF with a different detection setup and different screens [29] (LuAG∶Ce scintillator instead of OTR screen) and with the results of further WSC measurements described in the following. As a conclusion of this measurement session, the vertical profile of the electron beam at SITF was measured by means of an OTR screen and the related coaxial WSC—see Fig. 10—both placed at the optimum distance of about $3 \\mathrm { m }$ from the BLM.  \n  \n  \n The first beam test of the in-vacuum hardware of the SwissFEL WSC—see Fig. 1—was carried out at SITF in  \n Summer 2014. Goals of this first experimental test of the hardware of the SwissFEL WSC at SITF was the study of the (1) signal response of the beam loss monitor (BLM) when scanning a $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ beam with a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire and of the (2) optimum distance WSC-BLM at a beam energy of about $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M e V } .$ The wire-fork of this WSC prototype was equipped with 5 and $1 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wires. Several SwissFEL BLMs were also installed at different distances from the WSC: BLM1 at $0 . 6 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ (just at the junction of the vacuum-pipe with the WSC vacuumchamber), BLM2 at $2 . 3 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ and BLM3 at $3 . 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ . Since only two electronic boards of the PMT signal were available at that time, the simultaneous readout of only two BLMs was possible. Therefore, in two distinct WSC measurement sessions—beam energy of $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { \\ M e V }$ and charge of 10 and $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p C } .$ —the signals of both BLM1 and BLM2 and both BLM2 and BLM3 were simultaneously acquired, respectively. The results of the scan of a $1 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ beam with a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire being more relevant and meaningful—see Figs. 11 and 12—will be reported hereunder. Data in Fig. 11 were measured by BLM1 (at $0 . 6 \\mathrm { ~ m } \\rangle$ ) and BLM2 (at $2 . 3 \\mathrm { ~ m } \\dot { } ,$ ), while data in Fig. 12 by BLM2 (at $2 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m } \\dot { }$ ) and BLM3 (at $3 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { \\Omega }$ . The signal from each BLM has been normalized in proportion to the corresponding value of the PMT gain. Thus, the signal intensities of the beam profiles shown in Figs. 11 and 12 are comparable and indicative of the longitudinal intensity distribution of the wire signal. Since the experimental data shown in Figs. 11 and 12 belong to two different measurement sessions, they are not meaningful from the point of view of the beam size—which is not a relevant parameter in the present context anyhow, the beam size changing from a session to the other and the beam profile in Fig. 12 being clearly not Gaussian—but they can provide useful information about the BLM sensitivity and about the longitudinal distribution of the wire-signal intensity. From the comparative analysis of the signal detected by the three BLMs, a maximum of the wire-signal intensity was observed at the position of BLM3, i.e., at a distance of $3 . 5 \\mathrm { m }$ from the WSC. At a distance of $0 . 6 \\mathrm { m }$ from the WSC, the beam losses resulting from a $1 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ beam scanned by a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire were barely sufficient to measure a size of a few tens of $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . As an outcome of this experimental test, the sensitivity of the SwissFEL BLM is sufficient to detect wire signals resulting from the scan of a $1 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ beam with a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire. In addition, a further confirmation that the optimum distance WSC-BLM is expected to be around $3 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ at a beam energy of $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { M e V }$ can be drawn. Tests of the SwissFEL BLM in two-bunches operations were also carried out at SITF.  \n  \n  \n C. e-beam tests of the SwissFEL WSCs at FERMI  \n The experimental tests carried out at SITF— decommissioning started end 2014—could not give an answer to all the open issues of the design of the SwissFEL WSC. After the SITF experience, the suitability of the proposed detection technique of the wire signal at the GeV energy scale still needed to be verified as well as the scaling rule of the optimum distance between WSC and BLM as a function of the beam energy. Furthermore, the study of new wire materials would have taken advantage of possible beam tests at high energy and charge. On the basis of these motivations, a collaboration with FERMI started. A prototype of the in-vacuum component of the SwissFEL WSC— vacuum-chamber, UHV linear-stage and wire-fork—was installed at FERMI in the beam transport line from the linac to the undulator beam line just after the high energy spectrometer, see Figs. 13 and 14. Three SwissFEL BLMs were also installed at a distance from the WSC of 2.48, 5.52 and $8 . 4 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ , respectively. In particular, two BLMs were installed in the linac hall while a third one was installed in the undulator hall just behind the beam-stopper and a concrete wall separating the two halls. The light signal of each scintillator fiber—being transferred via a POF to the technical gallery—is converted to an electrical signal by a PMT having a variable gain. The PMT signal is finally digitized by a VME multichannel ADC board running at 250 Msamples=s.  \n Two series of experimental tests of the SwissFEL WSC were carried out at FERMI. In the first one, the wire-fork was equipped with two couples of tungsten wires with a diameter of 13 and $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , respectively. In the second one, the wire-fork was equipped with a couple of $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wires and a couple of $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\ \\mathrm { A l } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 )$ wires. Each couple of wires was composed of one horizontal wire for the measurement of the vertical profile of the electron beam and one vertical wire for the measurement of the other orthogonal projection of the electron beam.  \n  \n The first WSC test at FERMI—beam energy $1 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { G e V } ,$ charge of $3 0 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ , repetition rate $1 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ —aimed at checking the robustness of a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire and determining the optimum distance between WSC and BLM at the GeV energy scale. Beam profiles—as measured by the three aforementioned BLMs—during a scan with a 5 and a $1 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire are shown in Figs. 15(a,b) and in Figs. 15(c,d), respectively. The data plotted in Figs. 15(a,c) refer to the horizontal profile of the electron beam ${ \\mathrm { \\Delta } } ( \\sigma = 5 3 { \\mathrm { \\ } } \\mu { \\mathrm { m } }$ rms, $2 \\%$ statistical error), while the data in Figs. 15(b,d) are related to the vertical profile of the electron beam $( \\sigma = 8 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ rms, $2 \\%$ statistical error). The signals of the three BLMs plotted in Figs. 15 being absolute values are comparable in order to evaluate how the wiresignal strength varies along the beam line. According to the analysis of the signal intensity of the three BLMs—see Figs. 15—the optimum location of the BLM can be estimated at a distance from the WSC of about $5 { - } 6 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ for a beam energy of $1 . 5 \\mathrm { G e V . }$ Furthermore, the observation of a wire signal still appreciable at more than $8 \\mathrm { m }$ from the WSC and after a massive obstacle (concrete wall and beamstopper)—which suppresses or, at least, strongly reduces the particle shower passing from the linac to the undulator hall of FERMI—is reassuring about the possibility to detect the wire signal at a long distance from the WSC whenever this option is mandatory in particular machine sections or setups.  \n  \n The ratio of the radiation-dose measured by the three BLMs—BLM(1), BLM(2) and BLM(3)—during the wirescan measurements performed with the 5 and a $1 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wires—see measured beam profiles in Fig. 15—is shown in Table I. According to the measured values shown in Table I, the ratio of the integrated signals detected by BLM(2) and BLM(3)—which are 5.52 and $8 . 4 0 \\mathrm { m }$ far from the WSC, respectively—is similar and consistent with the prediction that is obtainable from Eq. (1) describing the radiation energy losses of a high energy beam interacting with a material of a given thickness $\\Delta x$ . According to Eq. (1), for a given beam energy $E _ { \\ast }$ , the radiation energy losses resulting from the interaction of a high energy electron beam with a given material scales up with the thickness of the material. Consequently, according to Eq. (1), the expected ratio of the radiation energy losses of a $1 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire to a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire is $1 3 / 5 =$ 2.6 in agreement with the data measured by BLM(2) and BLM(3), see Table I. The difference between the ratio of the radiation dose measured by BLM(1) and the ones measured by BLM(2) and BLM(3) as well can be explained by the circumstance that BLM(2) and BLM(3) are placed at distances—5.52 and $8 . 4 0 \\mathrm { m }$ , respectively—from the WSC which make them more suitable than BLM(1) in detecting the high energy—and small scattering angle—component of the wire signal. BLM(1) being closer to the WSC—only $2 . 4 8 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ away—is more sensitive to the low energy—large scattering angle—component of the particle shower produced in the interaction of the primary electron beam with the wire. Moreover, in the FERMI setup, BLM(1) is only separated from the WSC by a drift space, while several quadrupoles—not plotted in the sketch of Fig. 13—are placed in between the WSC and BLM(2) and BLM(3). Consequently, these quadrupoles play the role to filter the low energy component of the wire signal out of the vacuum chamber while getting most likely confined into the vacuum chamber the high energy component of the wire signal. The higher the energy of the wire signal—primary scattered electrons and secondary emitted electrons—and the smaller the corresponding scattering angle, the higher the probability that the wire signal be transported by the magnetic optics far away from the WSC inside the beam pipe. Consequently, for a high energy electron beam, the scaling rule of the radiation-dose measured by a BLM placed at a long distance from the WSC should be reasonably given by Eq. (1) as the experimental data shown in Table (I) are indicating. Further measurements carried out at FERMI—as in the following described— confirm such an interpretation.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I. Ratio of the radiation-dose measured at FERMI by BLM(1), BLM(2) and BLM(3) when scanning with $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and $1 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wires—at a motor speed of $0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s } .$ —the horizontal (Hor) and the vertical (Ver) profiles of a $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ electron beam (energy 1.5 GeV, 10 repetition rate). The values of the radiation-dose measured by the three BLMs at every scan were obtained by integrating the beam profiles plotted in Fig. 15. The relative distances from the WSC of the three beam-loss monitors BLM(1), BLM(2) and BLM(3) are: 2.48, 5.52 and $8 . 4 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ , respectively.

It resulted that a better accuracy in measuring the beam emittance can be achieved by using WSC as well as a more reliable and efficient matching of the magnetic optics to the design lattice (especially for a beam size of a few micrometers). Further outcome of this first WSC experience at FERMI was the observation that a wirescanning—with a 5 and $1 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire at a motor velocity of $0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ —is only barely perturbing the FEL emission process and, consequently, it can be routinely performed for on-line monitoring of the beam profile during FEL operations [30].  \n  \n A second series of WSC tests was performed at FERMI after substituting the previous wire-fork with a new one equipped with a couple of $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wires and a new wire solution. The new wire solution—new solution for WSC diagnostics, at least—consists of a couple of Alð99Þ∶Sið1Þ wires with a diameter of $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . This second series of WSC tests at FERMI aimed at: first of all, checking suitability and robustness of the $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\operatorname { \\cdot S i } } ( 1 )$ wires at a high beam energy and charge; then, determining the relative measurement accuracy of an $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\operatorname { \\cdot S i } } ( 1 )$ scan against a W scan; finally, quantifying the possible reduction of the radiation-dose release of an $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\mathrel { : } } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ wire scan in comparison with a tungsten wire scan. This comparative study $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\operatorname { \\cdot S i } } ( 1 )$ vs W was carried out at the FERMI linac which was set and tuned at a stable beam condition—energy $1 . 3 2 5 \\mathrm { G e V } ,$ charge $7 0 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ and repetition rate $1 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ —and at a fixed and matched magnetic optics. For different motorspeeds (0.1, 0.2 and $0 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ ) 10 wire-scans of the beam were performed with a ${ \\mathrm { ; ~ } } \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire and repeated with the homologous $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Alð99Þ∶Sið1Þ wire. At every scan, beam losses were measured at different locations with different detectors: with BLM1 (scintillator fiber placed at a distance of $2 . 4 8 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ from the WSC), with 2 Cerenkov fibers (Cerenkov1&2) stretched along the beam pipe of the FEL1 undulator beam-line and, finally, with 8 IonizationChambers—I-C $\\displaystyle 1  8 )$ )—placed in front, at the end and in between the 7 undulators composing the FEL1 undulator chain [31]. Experimental results of the comparative study $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\operatorname { \\cdot S i } } ( 1 )$ vs W are shown in Figs. 16–19. In Fig. 16, the profile of the electron beam resulting from the beam-losses measured by BLM1 during the scan with two homologous $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\operatorname { \\cdot S i } } ( 1 )$ and W wires moving at a motor-speed of $0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ is shown. The measured values of the beam size resulting from the analysis of the beam losses plotted in Fig. 16—for a motor-speed of $0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ —and from the analysis of other experimental beam profiles similarly acquired for motor-speeds of 0.1 and $0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ are shown Fig. 17. According to the experimental data plotted in Fig. 17, the same accuracy—within the limit of the statistical errors—is achieved by a $1 2 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { A l } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 )$ and a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ W wire in measuring a beam profile with a size of about $3 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . Furthermore, within the limit of the statistical errors, the measurement accuracy maintains constant in the motorspeed range $0 . 1 { - } 0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ .  \n Further goal of this WSC measurement session was to quantify the radiation-dose released along the machine when scanning—at different motor speeds—the electron beam with W and $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\colon } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ wires. The relative values of the radiation-dose measured by the detectors BLM1 and  \n Cerenkov1&2 and the absolute values of the radiation-dose rate $( \\mathrm { m G y / h } )$ measured by the 8 Ionization-Chambers I-C $( 1  8 )$ ) when scanning the beam with two homologous Alð99Þ∶Sið1Þ and W wires at a motor speed of $0 . 2 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ are shown in Table II. In Table II, the ratio—W against $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\mathrel { : } } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 ) .$ —of the measured values of the radiation-dose are shown as well. In particular, the absolute radiation-dose rate $( \\mathrm { m G y / h } )$ measured by the 8 Ionization-Chambers of the FERMI FEL1 when scanning—at a motor speed of $0 . 2 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ —the beam with two homologous wires $[ 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten and $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m \\ A l } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 ) ]$ is plotted in Fig. 18. According to the results shown in Table II and in Fig. 18, the radiation-dose rate measured by the 8 I-Cs of FERMI FEL1 when scanning the electron beam with a $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\mathrel { : } } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ at a motor speed of $0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ is a factor 11 smaller than the value measured in a scan with a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire. A reduction by a factor 11 of the radiation-dose released along the undulator chain of FERMI FEL1 was also observed at motor-speeds of 0.1 and $0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ as shown in Table III where the ratio—W against $\\mathbf { A l ( 9 9 ) } { \\mathrel { \\mathop : } } \\mathbf { S i } ( 1 ) .$ —of the absolute values of the radiation-dose rate measured by the 8 I-Cs are shown together with analogous results obtained from the other beam loss monitors. Finally, the radiation-dose rate measured by the 8 I-Cs during the scan of the electron beam with two homologous $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ $\\mathrm { A l } ( 9 9 ) { \\mathrel { : } } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 )$ and $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wires are compared in Fig. 19 for different motor-speeds (0.1, 0.2 and $0 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ ).  \n  \n  \n About the ratio of the radiation-dose measured by the three different detectors—BLM1 and Cerenkov1&2 and the 8 Ionization-Chambers I-C( $1  8 )$ )—during the comparative WSC measurements performed with $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\operatorname { \\cdot S i } } ( 1 )$ and W wires as reported in Tables II and III, the ratio of the radiation-dose measured by the 8 Ionization-Chambers $\\mathrm { I { \\mathrm { - } C } } ( 1  8 )$ is in agreement with the prediction of Eq. (1). In fact, taking into consideration the normalized radiation length of tungsten and aluminium [21]—0.35 and $8 . 8 9 \\mathrm { c m }$ , respectively—and the corresponding diameter of the wires—5 and $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , respectively—according to Eq. (1) the ratio of the radiation-dose tungsten against aluminium is expected to be equal to $\\begin{array} { r } { \\frac { 5 } { 1 2 . 5 } \\times \\frac { 8 . 8 9 } { 0 . 3 5 } = 1 0 . 2 . } \\end{array}$ . This analysis of the experimental data acquired by the 8 Ionization-Chambers ${ \\mathrm { I } } { \\mathrm { - C } } ( 1 \\to 8 )$ —as reported in Tables II and III—is consistent with the interpretation of similar experimental data already shown in Table I and previously discussed. As already commented in relation to the analysis of the experimental data in Table I, contrary to the BLM placed in a drift space at a distance of only $2 . 4 8 \\mathrm { m }$ from the WSC, the 8 Ionization-Chambers $\\operatorname { I - C } ( 1  8 )$ in the FEL1 undulator chain of FERMI are mainly sensitive to the high energy—and small scattering angle—component of the wire signal that is more likely transported through the entire vacuum chamber of the machine by the magnetic optics. Consequently, the relative ratio—tungsten against $\\mathrm { \\bar { A l } ( 9 9 ) } { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 ) .$ —of the radiation-dose measured by the 8 Ionization-Chambers $\\operatorname { I - C } ( 1  8 )$ —about a factor 11, see Table III—can be estimated by means of Eq. (1) that predicts a factor 10.2 as previously shown. Finally, the observed mismatch between the radiation dose measured by Cerenkov1&2 in FEL1—see Tables II and III—can be probably attributed to a different level of the signal amplification for the two Cerenkov fibers and/or a different sensitivity of the two detectors.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE II. Radiation-dose—averaged over 10 scans and integrated over 30 beam shots—measured in different positions of the FERMI machine when scanning the electron beam— ${ } ^ { . 7 0 0 } \\mathrm { p C }$ at $1 . 3 2 5 \\mathrm { \\ G e V }$ —with a $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\ \\mathrm { A l } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 )$ wire and a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire at a motor speed of $0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ . The ratio—W against Al 99 ∶Si 1 —of the measured radiation-dose is also shown. Absolute and relative measurements of radiation-dose have been performed with different detectors located at different positions of the machine. An absolute measurement of the radiation-dose rate $( \\mathrm { m G y / h } )$ released on the FEL1 undulator chain is obtained by a set of 8 IonizationChambers (I-Cs) located in front, behind and in between the 7 undulator composing the FEL1 undulator chain. A relative measurement of the radiation-dose release in the FEL1 undulator chain is also obtained by means of 2 Cerenkov fibers—Cerenkov(1,2)—which are stretched along the FEL1 vacuum chamber. Finally, a further relative radiation-dose measurement is achieved by means of the scintillator fiber—BLM(1)—placed at $2 . 4 8 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ from the WSC.

(1) and the application limits of such a formula. According to the experimental tests so far carried out, the formula in Eq. (1) can be considered to provide a phenomenological interpretation of the FERMI measurements. Further experimental tests are required for a generalization of such a formula to a most complete description of the beam energy losses in a WSC measurements. Nevertheless, the outcome of the FERMI experiments confirmed the utility of such a formula that, thanks to the simplicity of the numerical implementation, can offer an useful and prompt support to an experimentalist in order to evaluate—on the basis of a simple rule-ofthumb criterion—the most suitable material for a given WSC application. An empirical justification of the formula in Eq. (1)—which only accounts for the contribution of the longitudinal thickness of the wire to the beam energy losses—comes from the circumstance that its predictions fit in a satisfactory way with the measurements of those beam loss monitors—such as BLM(2) and BLM(3) and the 8 I-Cs of the FEL1 undulator chain of FERMI, see Tables I–III—which in FERMI can only detect an energy selected fraction of the particle shower produced by the wire. The aforementioned detectors are placed at a large distance from the WSC and with many magnetic elements (dipoles, quadrupoles, steerings) in between. BLM(1) is conversely placed in a drift space from the WSC without any magnetic element in between. As a function of the energy acceptance of the series of magnetic elements placed between the WSC and the beam loss monitor, the fraction of the wire particle shower which can be transported along the beam pipe and finally detected by the BLMs is the result of an energy selection of the primitive particle shower. Only primary electrons scattered by the wire and secondary emitted electrons with an energy distribution matching the energy acceptance of the beam line from the WSC up to the FEL1 undulator line can be indeed detected by the 8 Ionization Chambers (I-Cs) placed along the FERMI FEL1 undulator chain. The correspondence between the numerical predictions of Eq. (1)—only accounting for the contribution of the longitudinal wire size to the energy distribution of the wire particle shower—and the measurements of those beam-loss-monitors which detect an energy selected fraction of the wire particle shower can be considered an empirical justification of a formula which presently only aims at a phenomenological interpretation of the FERMI measurements.  \n  \n Table: Caption: TABLE III.

Two possible wire-material solutions for the SwissFEL WSC $( 1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ Al 99 ∶Si 1 and $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { W }$ wires) were tested at FERMI and both of them demonstrated a suitable beam robustness. The optimum distance of the BLM from the WSC was estimated between 5 and $6 \\mathrm { m }$ at the $\\mathrm { G e V }$ energy scale (at FLASH, an optimum distance WSC-BLM of about $4 . 8 \\mathrm { m }$ was estimated [13]). The new metallic wire solution—Al 99 ∶Si 1 — proposed as an alternative to the traditional tungsten solution showed a very good performance in terms of reduction of the radiation-dose release. Compared to a scan with a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ W wire, a drastic reduction—by a factor 11—of the radiationdose along the machine when scanning the beam with a $1 2 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\ \\mathrm { A l } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 )$ was indeed observed. Finally, the WSC test at FERMI demonstrated that the same accuracy can be achieved by the $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\ \\mathrm { A l } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 )$ and $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ W wires in measuring a beam size of about $3 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . Furthermore, this measurement accuracy was observed to remain constant—within the limit of the statistical errors— in the motor-speed range between 0.1 and $0 . 3 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ . The extrapolation of this result to the case of SwissFEL— repetition rate of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { H z } }$ , i.e., 10 times higher than FERMI—indicates that a sufficiently precise and machinesaving monitoring of a beam profile with a size of $3 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ can be still performed at SwissFEL with a $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { \\mathrel { : } } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ wire at a motor speed of $3 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m / s }$ .  \n III. CONCLUSIONS  \n The design features and the main prototyping steps of the SwissFEL wire scanners have been presented as well as the results of bench and electron-beam tests of the entire WSC setup. Electron beam tests were carried out at SITF and FERMI. The experimental characterization of the mechanical stability of the WSC confirmed that, in the motor-speed range of interest of SwissFEL $( 0 . 1 { - } 3 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m / s } )$ ), the wirevibration stays largely below the tolerance limit of $1 . 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (rms). According to the results of electron beam tests carried out at SITF, the detection setup of the wire signal showed a sufficient sensitivity to reconstruct the beam profile of a $1 0 \\ \\mathrm { p C }$ beam scanned by a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire and, in general, a sufficient large dynamics to cover the beam charge range $1 0 { - } 2 0 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ . Furthermore, thanks to the electron beam tests carried out at SITF and FERMI, the optimum distance between WSC and wire-signal detector was estimated to scale up between 3 and $6 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ in the beam energy range $0 . 2 5 0 { - } 1 . 5 \\mathrm { G e V } .$ Several solutions of metallic wires of different material and diameter have been tested on the electron beam at different conditions of charge and energy. In particular, comparative tests of the scanning performance of a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire and of $1 2 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { A l } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 )$ wire were carried out at FERMI at a beam energy of $1 . 3 2 5 \\mathrm { G e V }$ and charge of $7 0 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ . The results of this comparative study demonstrated a satisfactory robustness of the $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ wire to the beam loading as well as a comparable accuracy of the two wire-solutions in measuring an electron beam size of about $3 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . In addition, the radiation-dose measured at the FEL1 undulator chain of FERMI when scanning the beam with a $1 2 . 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { A l } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { S i } ( 1 )$ was about a factor 11 smaller than the one measured with a $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wire. On the basis of the outcome of the electron beam tests, the SwissFELWSC forks—being designed to be equipped with two distinct triplets of metallic wires—will be provided with $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ tungsten wires—for high precision measurements of the beam profile and emittance—and with $1 2 . 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ $\\mathrm { { A l } } ( 9 9 ) { : } \\mathrm { { S i } } ( 1 )$ wire for routine monitoring of the transverse profile of the electron beam during FEL operations. The prototyping and experimental characterization phases of the SwissFEL WSC being accomplished, WSC commissioning and operations in SwissFEL are expected to start by Summer 2016.  \n  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n The authors wish to thank the Paul Scherrer Institut expert groups, the SITF commissioning team and the FERMI operation crew for the support during the measurements.

Dielectric laser accelerators or plasma accelerators with external injection indeed require beam sizes at the micron level and below. We present a method using nano-fabricated metallic wires oriented at different angles to obtain projections of the transverse phase space by scanning the wires through the beam and detecting the amount of scattered particles. Performing this measurement at several locations along the waist allows assessing the transverse distribution at different phase advances. By applying a novel tomographic algorithm the transverse phase space density can be reconstructed. Measurements at the ACHIP chamber at SwissFEL confirm that the transverse phase space of micrometer-sized electron beams can be reliably characterized using this method.  \n DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.24.022802  \n I. INTRODUCTION  \n High-gradient advanced accelerator concepts including plasma and dielectric structure based schemes are developed at various laboratories for future compact accelerators.  \n The wavelength of the accelerating field in a plasma accelerator is given by the plasma wavelength which is typically on the order of tens of micrometers [1]. A dielectric laser accelerator (DLA) is operating in the optical to near-infrared spectrum leading to structure apertures on the order of a single micrometer [2]. Hence, suitable test beams for external injection have to be generated and characterized down to the submicrometer level.  \n Future compact free-electron laser facilities operating at small normalized emittances on the order of $5 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ rad [3] require profile monitors with micrometer resolution. Electron diffraction requires an even smaller emittance to achieve the required coherence [4].  \n Conventional beam profile monitors for ultrarelativistic electron beams are scintillating screens, optical transition radiation (OTR) screens and wire scanners. Screen-based methods provide single-shot two-dimensional information, whereas conventional wire scanners provide multishot onedimensional information.  \n  \n The thickness of the scintillating screen, the imaging lens and the camera pixel size limit the resolution of this method to around $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ to $1 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm m$ [5,6]. OTR screens with submicrometer resolution have been demonstrated, but their application is limited to uncompressed electron bunches [7]. Typical wire scanners at free-electron laser facilities consist of cylindrical metallic (aluminum or tungsten) wires with diameters down to $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ [8]. Projections of the transverse beam distribution can be measured by moving the stretched wire through the beam and correlating the wire position to the signal of a downstream beam loss monitor, which detects the scattered particle shower. Recent developments at PSI and FERMI led to single (onedimensional) wire scanners fabricated with electron beam lithography reaching sub-micrometer resolution [9,10]. Based on this technology we designed a wire scanner consisting of nine wires arranged radially at different angles, as a tool for precise beam profile tomography at the ACHIP (Accelerator on a Chip International Program) interaction chamber, which is installed in the Athos branch of SwissFEL at PSI (see Fig. 1). This chamber is planned to support DLA research and development [11,12]. A possible application of DLA technology for FELs is the generation of a micro-bunched pulse train using laser-based energy modulation followed by magnetic compression [13].  \n The electrons at the ACHIP interaction point at SwissFEL possess a mean energy of $3 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { G e V }$ and are strongly focused by an in-vacuum permanent magnet triplet [11].  \n A six-dimensional positioning system (hexapod) at the center of the chamber is used to exchange, align, and scan samples or a wire scanner for diagnostics.  \n In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the transverse phase space of a focused electron beam can be precisely characterized with a series of wire scans at different angles and locations along the waist. The transverse phase space $( x - x ^ { \\prime }$ and $y - y ^ { \\prime } )$ is reconstructed with a novel particlebased tomographic algorithm. This technique goes beyond conventional one-dimensional wire scanners since it allows us to assess the four-dimensional transverse phase space. We apply this algorithm to a set of wire scanner measurements performed with nano-fabricated wires at the ACHIP chamber at SwissFEL and reconstruct the dynamics of the transverse phase space of the focused electron beam along the waist.  \n II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP  \n A. Accelerator setup  \n The generation and characterization of a micrometer sized electron beam in the ACHIP chamber at SwissFEL requires a low-emittance electron beam. The beam size along the accelerator is given by:  \n $$\n\\sigma ( z ) = \\sqrt { \\beta ( z ) \\varepsilon _ { n } ( z ) / \\gamma ( z ) } ,\n$$ \n where $\\beta$ denotes the Twiss (or Courant-Snyder) parameter of the magnetic lattice, $\\gamma$ is the relativistic Lorentz factor of the electrons and $\\varepsilon _ { n }$ is the normalized emittance of the beam. With an optimized lattice a minimal $\\beta$ -function of around $1 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ in the horizontal and $1 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ in the vertical plane is expected from simulations [11,12].  \n In order to reduce chromatic effects of the focusing quadrupoles [14], we minimize the projected energy spread by accelerating the beam in most parts of the machine close to on-crest acceleration. From simulations, we expect an optimized projected energy spread of $4 2 \\mathrm { k e V }$ for a $3 { \\mathrm { G e V - } }$ beam with a charge of $1 \\ \\mathrm { p C }$ [11], which corresponds to a relative energy spread of $1 . 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ . For this uncompressed and low-energy-spread beam we expect chromatic enlargement of the focused beam size on the order of $0 . 1 \\%$ .  \n To lower the emittance of the beam, the bunch charge is reduced to approximately $1 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ from the nominal bunch charge at SwissFEL ( $1 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ to $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p C } )$ . The laser aperture and pulse energy at the photo-cathode, as well as the current of the gun solenoid, are empirically tuned to minimize the emittance for the reduced charge. The emittance is measured at different locations along the accelerator with a conventional quadrupole scan [15] and a scintillating YAG:Ce screen. After the second bunch compressor, which is the last location for emittance measurements before the ACHIP chamber, the normalized horizontal and vertical emittances are found to be $9 3 \\mathrm { n m }$ rad and $1 5 7 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ rad with estimated uncertainties below $10 \\%$ . The difference between the horizontal and vertical emittance could be the result of an asymmetric laser spot on the cathode. The electron energy at this emittance measurement location is $2 . 3 { \\mathrm { G e V . } }$ Subsequently, the beam is accelerated further to $3 . 2 \\mathrm { G e V }$ and directed to the Athos branch by two resonant deflecting magnets (kickers) and a series of dipole magnets [16]. Finally, the beam is transported to the beam stopper upstream of the Athos undulators.  \n  \n B. ACHIP chamber  \n The ACHIP chamber at SwissFEL is a multi-purpose test chamber, designed and built for DLA research. It is located in the switch-yard of SwissFEL, where the electron beam has an energy of around $3 . 2 \\mathrm { G e V . }$ The electron beam is focused by an in-vacuum quadrupole triplet and matched back by a second symmetric quadrupole triplet. All six magnets can be remotely retracted from the beam line for standard SwissFEL operation. The positioning system allows the alignment of the quadrupoles with respect to the electron beam. The magnetic center of the quadrupole is found by observing and reducing transverse kicks with a downstream screen or beam position monitor. At the center of the chamber a hexapod allows positioning different samples in the electron beam path. Figure 2 shows the interior of the ACHIP chamber including the permanent magnets and the hexapod. Further details about the design of the experimental chamber can be found in [11,12] and the first results of the beam characterization can be found in [17].  \n C. Nanofabricated wire scanner  \n Nanofabricated wires are installed on the hexapod for the characterization of the focused beam profile. The wire scan device consists of nine free-standing $1 \\mu \\mathrm m$ wide metallic (Au) stripes. The nine radial wires are supported by a spiderweb-shaped structure attached to a silicon frame. A scanning electron microscope image of the wire scanner sample is shown in Fig. 3. We chose nine homogeneously spaced wires for our design, since this configuration allows us to access any wire angle within the tilt limits of the hexapod. The sample was fabricated at the Laboratory for Micro and Nanotechnology at PSI by means of electron beam lithography. The $1 \\mu \\mathrm m$ wide stripes of gold are electroplated on a $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ thick $\\mathrm { S i } _ { 3 } \\mathrm { N } _ { 4 }$ membrane, which is removed afterwards with a KOH bath. The fabrication process and performance for this type of wire scanner are described in detail in [9]. The hexapod moves the wire scan device on a polygon path to scan each of the nine wires orthogonally through the electron beam. Hereby, projections along different angles $\\mathbf { \\eta } ^ { ( \\theta ) }$ of the transverse electron density can be measured. The two-dimensional transverse beam profile can be obtained using tomographic reconstruction techniques. The hexapod can position the wire scanner within a range of $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ along the beam direction $( z )$ . By repeating the wire scan measurement at different locations around the waist, the transverse phase space and emittance of the beam can be inferred.  \n  \n  \n D. Beam loss monitor  \n Electrons scatter off the atomic nuclei of the metallic wire and a particle shower containing mainly x-rays, electrons and positrons is generated. The intensity of the secondary particle shower depends on the electron density integrated along the wire and is measured with a downstream beam loss monitor (BLM). The BLM consists of a scintillating fiber wrapped around the beam pipe. The fiber is connected to a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The signal of the PMT is read-out beam synchronously in a shot-by-shot manner. To avoid saturation of the PMT, the gain voltage needs to be set appropriately. SwissFEL is equipped with a series of BLMs, which are normally used to detect unwanted beam losses and are connected to an interlock system. For the purpose of wire scan measurements, individual BLMs can be excluded from the machine protection system. Details about the BLMs at SwissFEL can be found in [18]. For the wire scan measurement reported here, a BLM located $1 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ downstream of the interaction with the wire was used.  \n III. TRANSVERSE PHASE SPACE RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM  \n Inferring a density distribution from a series of projection measurements is a problem arising in many scientific and medical imaging applications. Standard tomographic reconstruction techniques, e.g., filtered back projection or algebraic reconstruction technique [19] use an intensity on a grid to represent the density to be reconstructed. The complexity of these algorithms scales as $O ( n ^ { d } )$ , where $n$ is the number of pixels per dimension and $d$ is the number of dimensions of the reconstructed density. Typically, for real space density reconstruction, $d$ is 2 (slice reconstruction) or 3 (volume reconstruction). In the case of transverse phase space tomography $d$ equals 4 $( x , x ^ { \\prime } , y , y ^ { \\prime } )$ , leading to very long reconstruction times.  \n We developed a reconstruction algorithm based on a macroparticle distribution (instead of the intensity on grid), where each macroparticle, from now on called particle, represents a point in the four-dimensional phase space. The complexity of this algorithm is proportional to $n _ { p }$ (number of particles) and is independent on the dimension of the reconstruction domain. The particle density is then given by applying a Gaussian kernel to each coordinate of the particle ensemble:  \n $$\nG _ { \\kappa } = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 \\pi } \\rho _ { \\kappa } } \\exp { \\left( - \\frac { \\kappa ^ { 2 } } { 2 \\rho _ { \\kappa } ^ { 2 } } \\right) } , \\qquad \\kappa \\in \\{ x , x ^ { \\prime } , y , y ^ { \\prime } \\}\n$$ \n $$\n\\Delta ^ { i } = \\frac { 1 } { n _ { \\theta } n _ { z } } \\sum _ { \\theta , z } \\Delta _ { z , \\theta } ^ { i } .\n$$ \n where we choose $\\rho _ { x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } } = \\rho _ { x , y } / z _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ , with $z _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ the range of the measurement along z. Choosing the right kernel size is important for an appropriate reconstruction of the beam. It is dimensioned such that $\\rho _ { x , x ^ { \\prime } , y , y ^ { \\prime } }$ represents the length scale below which we expect only random fluctuations in the particle distribution, which are not reproducible from shot to shot. Note that despite the Gaussian kernel, this reconstruction does not assume a Gaussian distribution of the beam, but is able to reconstruct arbitrary distributions that vary on a length scale given by $\\rho _ { x , x ^ { \\prime } , y , y ^ { \\prime } }$ .  \n The ensemble of particles is iteratively optimized so that their projections match with the set of measured projections. The algorithm starts from a homogeneous particle distribution. One iteration consists of the following operations. (i) Transport $T ( z )$ (ii) Rotation $R ( \\theta )$ (iii) Histogram of the transported and rotated coordinates (iv) Convolution with wire profile (v) Interpolation to measured wire positions (vi) Comparison of reconstruction and measurement (vii) Redistribution of particles In the case of ultrarelativistic electrons transverse space charge effects can be neglected since they scale as $\\mathcal { O } ( \\gamma ^ { - 2 } )$ and hence $T ( z )$ becomes the ballistic transport matrix:  \n $$\nT ( z ) = { \\left( \\begin{array} { l l } { 1 } & { z } \\\\ { 0 } & { 1 } \\end{array} \\right) }\n$$ \n for $( x , x ^ { \\prime } )$ and $\\left( { y , y ^ { \\prime } } \\right)$ . The rotation matrix is then applied to $( x , y )$ :  \n $$\nR ( \\theta ) = { \\binom { \\cos \\theta } { - \\sin \\theta } } \\quad \\sin \\theta { \\Big ) } .\n$$ \n Afterwards, the histogram of the particles’ transported and rotated $x$ coordinates is calculated. Note that the bin width needs to be smaller than the width of the wire, to ensure an accurate convolution with the wire profile. This becomes important when the beam size or beam features are smaller than the wire width. Next, the convolution of the histogram and the wire profile is interpolated linearly to the measured wire positions $\\xi$ . Now, the reconstruction can be directly compared to the measurement:  \n $$\n\\Delta _ { z , \\theta } ( \\xi ) = \\frac { P _ { z , \\theta } ^ { m } ( \\xi ) - P _ { z , \\theta } ^ { r } ( \\xi ) } { \\operatorname* { m a x } _ { \\xi } P _ { z , \\theta } ^ { r } ( \\xi ) } ,\n$$ \n The sign of $\\Delta ^ { i }$ indicates if a particle is located in an over- or underdense region represented by the current particle distribution. According to the magnitude of $\\Delta ^ { i }$ the new particle ensemble is generated. A particle is copied or removed from the previous distribution with a probability based on $| \\Delta ^ { i } |$ . This process is implemented by drawing a pseudorandom number $\\chi ^ { i } \\in [ 0 , 1 [$ for each particle. In case $\\chi ^ { i } < | \\Delta ^ { i } | / s _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ , particle $i$ is copied or removed from the distribution (depending on the sign of $\\Delta ^ { i }$ ). Otherwise, the particle remains in the ensemble. Here, $s _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ is the maximum of all measured BLM signals and is used to normalize $\\Delta ^ { i }$ for the comparison with $\\chi ^ { i } \\in [ 0 , 1 [$ . This process makes sure that particles in highly underdense (overdense) regions are created (removed) with an increased probability.  \n In the last step of each iteration, a small random value is added to each coordinate according to the Gaussian kernel defined in Eq. (2). This smoothes the distribution on the scale of $\\rho$ . For the reconstruction of the measurement presented in Sec. IV, $\\rho _ { x , y }$ was set to $8 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ .  \n The iterative algorithm is terminated by a criterion based on the relative change of the average of the difference $\\Delta _ { z , \\theta } ^ { i }$ (further details in Appendix B). The measurement range along $z$ ideally covers the waist and the spacing between measurements is reduced close to the waist, since the phase advance is the largest here. Since the algorithm does not where $P _ { z , \\theta } ^ { m }$ and $P _ { z , \\theta } ^ { r }$ are the measured and reconstructed projections for the current iteration at position $z$ and angle $\\theta$ . The difference between both profiles quantifies over- and underdense regions in the projection. Then, $\\Delta _ { z , \\theta } ( \\xi )$ is interpolated back to the particle coordinates along the wire scan direction, yielding $\\Delta _ { z , \\theta } ^ { i }$ for the ith particle. Afterwards, we calculate the average over all measured $z$ and $\\theta$ :  \n  \n assume a specific shape (e.g., Gaussian) of the distribution, asymmetries, double-peaks, or halos of the distribution can be reconstructed (an example is shown in Appendix C). Properties of the transverse phase space including, transverse emittance in both planes, astigmatism and Twiss parameters can be calculated from the reconstructed distribution. To obtain the full 4D emittance, cross-plane information, such as correlations in $x - y ^ { \\prime }$ or $x ^ { \\prime } - y$ need to be assessed. For this purpose, the phase advance has to be scanned independently in both planes. This can be achieved with a multiple quadrupole scan as explained for instance in [20,21] but is not achieved by measuring beam projections along a waist, as the phase advance in both planes is correlated.  \n The presented phase space reconstruction algorithm could also be adapted to use two-dimensional profile measurements from a screen at different phase advances to characterize the four-dimensional transverse phase space.  \n The python-code related to the described tomographic reconstruction technique is made available on github [22].  \n A. Reconstruction of a simulated measurement  \n To verify the reconstruction algorithm, we generate a test distribution and calculate a set of wire scan projections (nine projections along different angles at seven locations along the waist). The algorithm then reconstructs the distribution based on these simulated projections. For this test, we choose a Gaussian beam distribution with Twiss parameters $\\beta _ { x } ^ { * } = 2 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ , $\\beta _ { y } ^ { * } = 3 . 0 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ and a transverse emittance of 200 nm rad in both planes. An astigmatism of $- 1 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ (longitudinal displacement of the horizontal waist) is artificially introduced. Moreover, noise is added to the simulated wire scan profiles to obtain a signal-to-noise ratio similar to the experimental data show in Sec. IV. The Gaussian kernel size for the reconstruction $\\rho _ { x , y }$ [see Eq. (2)] is $8 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , which is around one order of magnitude smaller than the beam size in this test. Figure 4 compares the original and reconstructed transverse phase space at $z = 0$ cm. Good agreement ( $\\text{‰}$ error) is achieved for the emittances and astigmatism, which is manifested as a tilt in the $x - x ^ { \\prime }$ plane. For this numerical experiment, the algorithm terminates according to the criterion described in Appendix B after around 100 iterations. The run-time on a single-core of a standard personal computer is around two minutes. Parallelizing the computation on several cores would reduce the computation time by few orders of magnitude.  \n  \n fluctuations, or density variations of the electron beam. The effect of these error sources is discussed further in Appendix A. The evolution of the reconstructed transverse phase space along the waist is depicted in Fig. 6. The expected rotation of the transverse phase space around the waist is clearly observed. The position of the waist is found to be at around $z = 6 . 2$ cm downstream of the center of the chamber.  \n IV. RESULTS  \n We have measured projections of the transverse electron beam profile at the ACHIP chamber at SwissFEL with the accelerator setup, wire scanner and BLM detector described in Sec. II. All nine wire orientations are used at six different locations along the waist of the electron beam. This results in a total of 54 projections of the electron beam’s transverse phase space. Lowering the number of projections limits the possibility to observe inhomogeneities of the charge distribution. The distance between measurement locations is increased along $z$ , since the expected waist location was around $z = 0 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ . All 54 individual profiles are shown in Fig. 5. In each subplot, the orange dashed curve represents the projection of the reconstructed phase space for the respective angle $\\theta$ and longitudinal position z. The reconstruction represents the average distribution over many shots and agrees with most of the measured data points. Discrepancies arise due to shot-to-shot position jitter, charge  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I.

We quantify the normalized emittance and $\\beta$ -function of the distribution by fitting a 2D Gauss function to the distribution in the $( x , x ^ { \\prime } )$ and $( y , y ^ { \\prime } )$ phase space. The 1- $\\mathbf { \\sigma } \\cdot \\sigma _ { \\mathbf { \\lambda } }$ ellipse of the fit is drawn in blue in all subplots of Fig. 6. We use the following definition for the normalized emittance:  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { n } = \\gamma A _ { 1 \\sigma } / \\pi ,\n$$ \n where $A _ { 1 \\sigma }$ is the area of the $_ { 1 - \\sigma }$ ellipse in transverse phase space. The values for the reconstructed emittance, minimal $\\beta$ -function $( \\beta ^ { * } )$ and beam size at the waist are summarized in Table I. The measurement range $( 8 \\mathrm { c m } )$ along the waist with $\\beta ^ { * } = 3 . 7$ cm covers a phase advance of around $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ .  \n V. DISCUSSION  \n The reconstructed phase space represents the average distribution of many shots, since shot-to-shot fluctuations in the density cannot be characterized with multishot measurements like wire scans. Errors induced by total bunch charge fluctuations and position jitter of the electron beam could be corrected for by evaluating beam-synchronous BPM data. Since the BPMs in the Athos branch were still uncalibrated, their precision was insufficient to correct orbit jitter in our measurement. This issue is considered further in Appendix A.  \n The expected waist is located at the center of the chamber $z = 0 \\mathrm { c m } )$ , whereas the reconstructed waist is found $6 . 2 \\mathrm { c m }$ downstream. In addition, the $\\beta$ -function at the waist $( \\beta ^ { * } )$ was measured to be around $3 . 6 \\ \\mathrm { c m }$ in both planes, which is in disagreement with the design optics $( \\beta _ { x } ^ { * } = 1 ~ \\mathrm { c m }$ , $\\beta _ { y } ^ { * } = 1 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { c m } ,$ ). This indicates that the beam is mismatched at the chamber entrance and improving the matching of the electron beam to the focusing lattice could provide even smaller (submicrometer) beams in the ACHIP chamber.  \n The reconstructed normalized emittances are up to a factor of two larger than the normalized emittances measured after the second bunch compressor. This emittance increase can be attributed to various reasons. Within a distance of $1 0 3 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ the electron beam is accelerated from $2 . 3 { \\mathrm { G e V } }$ (conventional emittance measurement) to around $3 . 2 { \\mathrm { ~ G e V } }$ and is directed to the Athos branch with a fast kicker and a series of bending magnets. Chromatic effects in the lattice, transverse offsets in the accelerating cavities or leaking dispersion from dispersive sections in the switch-yard can lead to a degradation of the emittance along the accelerator. These effects were not precisely characterized and corrected before the measurement, since the priority was to validate a new method for transverse phase space characterization of a strongly focused ultrarelativistic electron beam.  \n  \n Another possible explanation for the discrepancy of the emittances: the conventional emittance measurement uses the horizontal and vertical beam profiles measured for different phase advances (quadrupole currents) with a scintillating screen (single-shot). A Gaussian fit to the beam profiles at each phase advance is used to estimate the emittance [15]. In contrast, the tomographic wire scan technique presented here reconstructs the transverse phase space averaged over many shots. Afterwards, a Gaussian fit estimates the area of the distribution in the transverse phase space. Both large shot-to-shot jitter and non-Gaussian beams can give rise to differences between the results of the two techniques. The wire scan acquisition time could be reduced by using fewer projection angles. This could be done, if less detailed information on the beam distribution is acceptable, e.g., if only projected beam sizes are of interest, two projection angles are sufficient. The optimal number of angles depends on the internal beam structure and the beam quantities of interest.  \n A. Resolution limit  \n The ultimate resolution limit of the presented tomographic characterization of the transverse beam profile depends on the roughness of the wire profile. With the current fabrication process, this is on the order of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ estimated from electron microscope images of the freestanding gold wires. This is one to two orders of magnitude below the resolution of standard profile monitors for ultrarelativistic electron beams (YAG:Ce screens) [5,6].  \n B. Comparison to other profile monitors  \n The scintillating screens (YAG:Ce) at SwissFEL achieve an optical resolution of $8 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , and the smallest measured beam sizes are $1 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ [6]. At the Pegasus Laboratory at UCLA beam sizes down to $5 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ were measured with a $2 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick YAG:Ce screen in combination with an invacuum microscope objective [5]. Optical transition radiation (OTR) based profile monitors are only limited by the optics and camera resolution [23]. At the Accelerator Test Facility 2 at KEK this technique was used to measure a beam size of $7 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ [7]. However, OTR profile monitors are not suitable for compressed electron bunches (e.g., at FELs) due to the emission of coherent OTR [24].  \n At the SLAC Final Focus Test Beam experiment a laserCompton monitor was used to characterize a $7 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ wide beam along one dimension [25]. The cost and complexity of this system, especially for multiangle measurements, are its main drawbacks.  \n Concerning radiation hardness of the nanofabricated wire scanner, tests with a single wire and a bunch charge of $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { p C }$ at a beam energy of $3 0 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ at SwissFEL did not show any sign of degradation after repeated measurements [9].  \n VI. CONCLUSION  \n In summary, we have presented and validated a novel technique for the reconstruction of the transverse phase space of a strongly focused, ultrarelativistic electron beam. The method is based on a series of wire scans at different angles and positions along the waist. An iterative tomographic algorithm has been developed to reconstruct the transverse phase space. The technique is validated with experimental data obtained in the ACHIP chamber at SwissFEL. The method could be applied to other facilities and experiments, where focused high-brightness electron beams need to be characterized, for instance at plasma acceleration or DLA experiments for matching of an externally injected electron beam, emittance measurements at future compact low-emittance FELs [3], or for the characterization of the final-focus system at a high-energy collider test facility. For the latter application, the damage threshold of the free-standing nano-fabricated gold wires needs to be identified and radiation protection for the intense shower of scattered particles needs to be considered. Nevertheless, the focusing optics could be characterized with the presented method using a reduced bunch charge.  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n We would like to express our gratitude to the SwissFEL operations crew, the PSI expert groups, and the entire ACHIP collaboration for their support with these experiments. We would like to thank Thomas Schietinger for careful proofreading of the manuscript.

Position errors  \n The uncertainty of the position of the wire scanner with respect to the electron beam is affected by the readout precision of the hexapod $( < 1 ~ \\mathrm { n m } )$ , vibrational motion of the hexapod $\\phantom { + } < 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } } )$ and position jitter of the electron beam, which at SwissFEL is typically a few-percent of the beam size. The orbit of the electron beam is measured with BPMs along the accelerator. Unfortunately, the BPMs along the Athos branch of SwissFEL have not been calibrated (the measurement took place during the commissioning phase of Athos). Nevertheless, we tried correcting the orbit shot-by-shot based on five BPMs and the magnetic lattice around the interaction point. However, it does not reduce the measured beam emittance, as their position reading is not precise enough to correct orbit jitter at the wire scanner location correctly. Therefore, we do not include corrections to the wire positions based on BPMs. The reconstructed beam phase space represents the average distribution for many shots including orbit fluctuations. After the calibration of the BPMs in Athos we plan to characterize the effect of orbit jitter to wire scan measurements in detail.  \n  \n 2. Amplitude errors  \n Jitter to the BLM signal is introduced by read-out noise of the PMT $( < 1 \\% )$ , charge fluctuations of the machine and halo-particles scattering at other elements of the accelerator. The charge measured by the BPMs fluctuated by $1 . 3 \\%$ (rms) during the measurement. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the measurements varies from 25 to 45 depending on the respective projected beam size. We define the SNR as: $s _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } / \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { n o i s e } }$ , where $s _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ is the maximum of the signal and $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { n o i s e } }$ refers to the standard deviation of the background.  \n 3. Uncertainty of the reconstruction  \n Due to the error sources mentioned above the measured projections are not fully compatible with each other, i.e., the reconstructed distribution cannot match to all measured data points. The error of the reconstructed phase space density and the derived quantities is estimated by a procedure similar to the main reconstruction algorithm. The reconstructed distribution is now taken as input. Instead of averaging over all projections, the iteration is performed for each projection individually. Hence, a set of $n _ { z } \\times n _ { \\theta }$ distributions is generated, in which each distribution matches best to one measured projection. All derived quantities, such as the emittance or $\\beta$ -function, are computed for each distribution and the error is taken as the standard deviation of this set.  \n APPENDIX B: TERMINATION CRITERIONFOR RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHM \n The algorithm to reconstruct the phase space from wire scan measurements iteratively approximates the distribution that fits best to all measurements (see Sec. III). The iteration is stopped when a criterion based on the relative change from the current to the previous iteration is reached. We define $p _ { k }$ as the average probability for a particle to be added or removed to the ensemble in iteration $k$ .  \n $$\np _ { k } = \\frac { 1 } { n _ { p } n _ { \\theta } n _ { z } } \\sum _ { i , \\theta , z } \\lvert \\Delta _ { z , \\theta } ^ { i } \\rvert\n$$ \n The iteration terminates when the relative change of $p _ { k }$ reaches a tolerance limit $\\tau$ :  \n $$\n\\frac { \\left| p _ { k } - p _ { k - 1 } \\right| } { \\left| p _ { k } \\right| } < \\tau\n$$ \n For the case of the presented data set $\\tau = 0 . 0 0 5$ is found to provide stable convergence and a consistent solution. Around 110 iterations are required to reach the termination criterion.  \n APPENDIX C: RECONSTRUCTION OF NON-GAUSSIAN BEAMS  \n Our particle based tomographic reconstruction algorithm does not assume any specific shape for the density profile. Therefore, asymmetric density variations, such as tails of a localized core can be reconstructed. To demonstrate this capability of our tomographic technique, we show here a measurement of a non-Gaussian beam shape and compare the result to a 2D Gaussian fit. This measurement was performed with different machine settings than the measurement presented in Sec. IV. The electron bunch carried a charge of around $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ . The transverse beam profile was characterized with nine wire scans at different angles at one z position. Therefore we can only reconstruct the twodimensional $( x , y )$ beam profile. The measurement and the tomographic reconstruction are shown in Fig. 8. For comparison, we add the result of a single two-dimensional Gaussian fit to all nine measured projections (Fig. 9). The core and tails observed in the measurement are well represented by the tomographic reconstruction, whereas the Gaussian fit overestimates the core region by trying to approximate the tails.  \n  \n [1] E.

This manuscript presents a methodology that combines existing slow-measurement methods currently used in gas detectors across the world and fast uncalibrated signals from multipliers, meant for relative flux pulse-to-pulse measurements, which create a shot-to-shot absolute flux measurement through the use of sensor-based conditional triggers and algorithms at SwissFEL.  \n 1. Introduction  \n The need for an absolute online measurement of photon flux at $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray free-electron lasers (FELs) has been apparent since the inception of these new large-scale devices. The photon pulse energy is one of the main measures of the effectiveness of the FEL setup, and is used for, among other things, gain curve measurements of the undulators, sorting of data to find non-linear effects in experiments and judging the effectiveness of different machine setups. This measurement of the pulse energy has been pioneered by the diagnostics group at the Free Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) at the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) and the X-ray gas monitor detector (XGMD) developed there (Sorokin et al., 2019). Use of this technology as an online measurement has spread to other FELs, with similar devices now existing at facilities such as LCLS, SACLA, FERMI, European XFEL and SwissFEL (Sorokin et al., 2019; Tiedtke et al., 2014; Zangrando et al., 2009; Gru¨ nert et al., 2019; Owada et al., 2018; Tono et al., 2013). The accuracy of the XGMD system has been confirmed several times at various facilities with measurements against a radiative bolometer using both soft and hard X-rays (Tiedtke et al., 2014; Kato et al., 2012; Juranic et al., 2019). The XGMD mainly measures the flux on a long time scale, evaluating the total current on a copper plate from the ions that have been photoionized and then drawn to the plate by a strong electric field. The hardware and robustness of the device ensures the accuracy of the measurement, but it delivers data on a long time scale, typically giving an average current in roughly 10 to $3 0 { \\mathrm { ~ s . } }$ The XGMD has the option to measure the electron current on the plates opposite the ions and extract a shot-toshot evaluation that can be calibrated to the pulse energy, but this feature requires a very high photon flux or a large crosssection for sufficient signal, with the latter available only for soft X-rays. The XGMD is an excellent tool to evaluate the average pulse energy, but it cannot provide a single-shot evaluation of the pulse energy for hard $\\mathbf { X }$ -rays and low fluxes.  \n Another component of the gas detector system developed by DESY and used at various facilities, including SwissFEL, is the huge aperture open multiplier (HAMP), which is a large multiplier used for single-shot relative flux measurements that are not an absolute evaluation of the pulse energy. The response of this device to the ions generated from the photoionization depends on the potential that they are operated under, and the energy and charge of the photoionized ions that are impacting the HAMP surface. Furthermore, this response changes with time, as the multiplier coating slowly depletes over years of use. It is theoretically possible to evaluate the absolute single-shot pulse energy from the HAMP measurements if one can characterize the multiplier for every gas type and pressure, photon energy and voltage setting, year after year. Furthermore, the multiplier itself must be set with a voltage that has the signal generated by the ion impact to be in the linear regime. A constant monitoring of the signal amplitude must be implemented that feeds back on the multiplier voltage to ensure the operation of this device in a reliable manner. It was developed to deal with hard X-rays and lower fluxes which are encountered at most hard $\\mathbf { X }$ -ray FEL facilities.  \n This manuscript describes the developments in hardware characterization, feedback and monitoring programs, and processing algorithms that allow the photon pulse energy monitor (PBIG) at SwissFEL to deliver absolute pulse energy evaluations on a shot-to-shot basis (Juranic´ et al., 2018). The PBIG is the renamed DESY-developed and constructed pulse energy monitor, and the methods proposed here can be adapted to any similar device at FELs around the world.  \n 2. Measurement setup  \n 2.1. Detector reliability  \n The precursor to effective data processing and evaluation of pulse-resolved pulse energy is the reliability of the input data for this evaluation. The XGMD slow absolute energy measurement must be calibrated against another device, and the fast HAMP measurement has to be operating so it can react linearly to the incoming pulse energies, and hence the data collected for eventual algorithmic processing are not dominated by noise or empty measurements.  \n The XMGD average pulse energy measurements are linear and were calibrated in previous work (Juranic et al., 2019). The copper plate from which the current is measured by a Keithley 6514 calibrated multimeter has a quantum efficiency of 1, and the multimeter has a linear measurement range for current measurements that spans more than ten orders of magnitude. This device provides the calibrated long-scale average signal that will be used to evaluate the shot-to-shot pulse energy from the HAMPs.  \n The HAMPs, in contrast, need characterization to evaluate their range of linearity under an applied gain voltage. This voltage needs to be regulated through an overwatch program so that the HAMP detector signals remain linear, while also being high enough to provide a good signal-to-noise ratio on its analog-to-digital converter (ADC). An example of the ion signal on the ADC from the HAMP is presented by Sorokin et al. (2019). Since the response of the HAMP multiplier also changes with the photon energy, pulse energy and gas type, the most appropriate metric to observe in order to ensure linearity is the signal from the HAMP itself, or its maximum absolute peak height. The commissioning of the HAMP at SwissFEL used the fact that we have two such devices, one oriented along the vertical axis and another along the horizontal axis, and kept the settings of the horizontal (HAMP-X) constant and in the linear range, and changed the gain voltage on the vertical (HAMP-Y) to observe which peak heights are in the linear range. Further consultations with the team at DESY who built the devices concluded that the detector is linear between the maximum peak voltage of $1 \\mathrm { m V }$ and $1 0 \\mathrm { m V }$ , which translates to $1 0 \\mathrm { m V }$ and $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m V }$ on the ADC due to a $2 0 \\mathrm { d B }$ pre-amplifier between the HAMP and the 16-bit Ioxos ADC card used at the Aramis branch of SwissFEL. As shown in Fig. 1, the linear response also extends beyond this range and only begins to be non-linear once the peak value of the signal reaches around $0 . 9 \\mathrm { V } .$ . The ADC maximum input voltage restricts the maximum signal strength to $1 \\mathrm { V }$ resulting in the flat line once this value is reached.  \n  \n The controls system at SwissFEL reads the shot-to-shot voltage peaks from the HAMPs, and if the peak reading is above $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m V }$ or below $1 0 \\mathrm { m V }$ for longer than $1 0 \\mathrm { ~ s ~ }$ it changes the HAMP gain voltage by $5 0 \\mathrm { V }$ appropriately. This active feedback on the HAMP readings, combined with a large linear response ‘buffer’, ensures there is sufficient time during the HAMP voltage changes to ensure the device is always linearly responding to the X-ray beam pulse energy.  \n Further measures to ensure the reliability of the gas detector setup include a system that stops its data-processing whenever the electron and photon beams are shut off, either accidentally or intentionally. The two elements monitored to determine whether the PBIG data are processed are the bunch charge determined by the monopole cavity of an electron online beam position monitor (DBPM) in the linear accelerator, and the photon shutter. If the DBPM reading is in a valid state and can detect the electron beam, and the shutter is open, acquisition and processing can take place. If either of these two criteria is not met, the data processing is suspended, and the pulse energy reading for both the fast and the slow signals is automatically set to zero.  \n  \n 2.2. Algorithm for data-processing  \n The core of the data processing and evaluation of the absolute pulse energy on a shot-to-shot basis is the evaluation of the ratio between the slow signals and the fast signals. The slow absolute evaluation from the XGMD has an integration time of about $1 0 { \\mathrm { ~ s } } .$ , updated every second as the Keithley multimeter updates its readout. The fast signal reads out the relative pulse energy from the integral of the ion peaks at the repetition rate of SwissFEL, up to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ . To be able to compare these two evaluations with each other directly on a pulse-by-pulse basis, we first create a rolling buffer of pulseresolved measurements that is as long as or longer than the XGMD evaluation integration time. The rolling buffer always maintains the same number of elements, adding a new element with each new processed FEL pulse, while dropping the oldest element in the buffer. The rolling buffer is updated at the repetition rate of the FEL, and is used to continuously evaluate the conversion constant $C _ { i }$ so that  \n $$\nC _ { i } \\ = \\ I _ { \\mathrm { X G M D } } / I _ { \\mathrm { H A M P } } ,\n$$ \n where $I _ { \\mathrm { X G M D } }$ and ${ \\cal I } _ { \\mathrm { H A M P } }$ are the evaluations of the XGMD and HAMP signal data in the buffer, respectively. This constant is then used in further evaluations. A weighted average algorithm is used to evaluate the current conversion constant so that  \n $$\nC = W C _ { i } + \\left( 1 - W \\right) C _ { i - 1 } ,\n$$ \n where $W$ is the weighting factor, equal to the period of the FEL divided by the chosen buffer length time constant, and $C _ { i - 1 }$ is the previous conversion constant. A 10 s time constant and $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ repetition rate would yield a weighting factor of 0.001. The role of this weighting factor and the data buffer is to ensure that the conversion constant between the XGMD and HAMP readouts is not affected by single-shot losses of pulse energies and remains stable unless the relationship between the two devices is altered due to a change in photon energy or multiplier voltage gain. The FEL radiation can vary significantly on a shot-to-shot basis owing to the stochastic nature of the self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), so such a large buffer is necessary to establish a suitable conversion constant between the two devices. The last step of the data processing is to evaluate the single pulse energy, which is equal to C IHAMP .  \n If the repetition rate of the FEL changes, the rolling buffer size is recalculated to accommodate the larger number of points in the chosen time period, and the buffer itself is reset. However, the constant $C$ remains unchanged unless the photon energy or the HAMP gain voltage change.  \n The data buffer and single-shot pulse energy evaluation process is restarted when the FEL changes its photon energy or the HAMP gain voltage changes by more than $1 0 \\mathrm { V } ,$ , since both of these alter the ratio between the XGMD and HAMP readings. Once the rolling buffer is full, an algorithm checks the data within the rolling buffer and checks whether the data are within the stability criteria set to evaluate the ratio. In the case of SwissFEL, these stability criteria are based on the HAMP and XGMD data, with the most commonly used stability criteria being that the XGMD readings should have a peak-to-peak variance of less than $5 \\%$ of the average pulse energy over the length of the rolling buffer. These criteria ensure that the conversion constant between the XGMD and HAMP readings is taken when the beam is in a stable mode, and gives an accurate evaluation of the conversion constant $C$ . If the beam is not on, the rolling buffer is not full, or the beam stability is not within the set parameters, $C$ is not updated, and the constant that existed up to that point is used. As long as the HAMP voltage or the photon energy does not change, $C$ is constant for the calculations, as the HAMP response relative to the XGMD signal does not change. If there is no constant, no fast absolute pulse energy is displayed until the constant can be evaluated. If the beam is on, the rolling buffer is full and the beam is within the stability criteria, the calibration constant $C$ updates with every pulse according to the process described above. The flowchart in Fig. 2 illustrates the dataprocessing flow.  \n  \n 3. Results and discussion  \n The resulting evaluation of the absolute single-shot pulse energy matches both the absolute numbers measured by the XGMDs, and shows the shot-to-shot fluctuations of their amplitudes, as seen in Fig. 3. The fast measurement comparison was made under conditions that kept the HAMP gain voltage constant, at a constant photon energy. The ratio between the two HAMPs comes from the different detector responses. The signal yields vary between different HAMPs due to the artisanal quality of their manufacturing and coating procedure, in this case by about $3 0 \\%$ . The standard deviation from the mean ratio of the signals from HAMP-Y versus HAMP-X was about $1 . 4 \\%$ , which is also the relative measurement accuracy of the single-shot measurement.  \n Additionally, the fast algorithm can react quickly to sudden drops in pulse energy, showing the sudden stop and return to lasing almost instantaneously, while the slow signal takes significant time to ramp back up, as shown in Fig. 4. This allows users who need to stop and restart their measurements to resume reliable data collection more quickly, and the operators can immediately see how well the FEL is lasing after some kind of a temporary failure, without waiting for up to $3 0 { \\mathrm { ~ s . } }$ The fast signal can also be employed for faster acquisitions of gain curve scans of the undulators (Milton et al., 2001) and quicker optimization algorithms for machine performance owing to a faster monitoring parameter as the main input (Kirschner et al., 2022).  \n  \n The method and algorithm described here have been shown to work at SwissFEL with its repetition rate of up to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ . The optimization of the algorithm to process the data has been shown to be $1 0 0 \\%$ reliable even at the maximum $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ repetition rate, has no skipped points and matches perfectly with other beam-synchronous measurements. Other facilities with larger repetition rates may have more difficulty in finding the time necessary between the pulses to execute full evaluations to provide a real-time single-shot pulse energy measurement. However, the algorithm can also be used to assign pulse energies to data after the fact, though some of the features such as fast online optimization and quick gain curve acquisition would be lost.  \n 4. Conclusions  \n The development of the absolute fast pulse energy measurement is a step forward in creating a system that can be more responsive to lasing efficiency and fluctuations. Most gasbased pulse energy detectors currently offer a choice between a fast uncalibrated signal or a slow calibrated signal to investigate and optimize machine performance, both of which have downsides. A slow calibrated signal leads to a slow correction response, whereas a fast uncalibrated signal only works while the pulse energy or photon energy are within parameters that enable full functionality of the fast signals, like the HAMPs. The absolute fast pulse energy measurement ensures a fast response to both large and small changes, and would be significantly faster than the slow calibrated signal.  \n Though the setup described is fast, an even better setup would be one where the evaluation of the pulse energy would depend completely on values measured from the HAMPs, their gain voltage and a photon energy. This is theoretically possible, but would require a long-term project to gather sufficient data to correlate these parameters to the absolutely measured pulse energy on a shot-to-shot basis, and a setup that ensures every data point measured is valid. The scheme described in this manuscript creates such a system.  \n The data gathered by the fast pulse energy measurement are currently evaluated using a comparison against the slow pulse energy measurement. However, with enough time and data points, one could use this data to create a machinelearning algorithm that would enable the evaluation of the pulse energy directly, without having to compare the HAMP values with the slow calibrated XGMD signals. In that respect, the effort described here is the first step to eventually create a wholly calibrated fast pulse energy measurement for all possible beam parameters.  \n "

Initially developed for medical applications [1, 2], in particular for Positron Emission Tomography (PET), its characteristics in terms of high mass density (twice the density of NaI(Tl)), fast scintillation kinetics (6 times faster decay time than BGO) and high light yield ( $4 0 0 0 0 \\mathrm { p h / M e V ) }$ attracted also the interest of the High Energy Physics (HEP) community.  \n In the last decade, LYSO:Ce was employed to prototype and realize high precision electromagnetic calorimeters such as the one designed for the $ { \\mathrm { M u } } 2  { \\mathrm { e } }$ experiment [3] and the CCALT forward calorimeter of the KLOE-2 experiment [4].  \n More recently, a new crystal R&D effort driven by the requirement for high time resolution of second generation PET (Time of Flight PET) further improved the performance of LYSO leading to the industrial production of faster crystals (decay time $< 4 0 \\mathrm { n s }$ ) and with higher light yield than in the past [5, 6]. The latter, together with the excellent resistance to $\\gamma$ radiation [7], neutrons [8] and charged hadrons [9], makes LYSO appealing for timing applications in the harsh environment of future high-luminosity particle colliders. In this context, the high rate of simultaneous interactions per bunch crossing (pileup) will produce spatial overlap of tracks and energy deposits. This will affect the capability to disentangle physics events through the traditional detector layers. A picosecond timing layer dedicated to time of arrival measurement of charged particles can help to associate tracks to the correct vertex, mitigating the pileup effect. For this purpose, the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron collider (LHC) chose LYSO:Ce crystals coupled to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) to design the sensor unit for the barrel part (BTL) of its timing layer, the MIP Timing Detector [10]. With this layout, the BTL will be able to provide precision timing of minimum ionizing particles with a resolution of 30–60 ps [11], restoring the event reconstruction performance of the pre-high-luminosity era.  \n In this paper, a comparative and systematic study of LYSO:Ce crystal properties is carried out, for the first time for a wide number of crystal samples and crystal manufacturers, with particular attention to the key features responsible for the timing performance of the crystals. The aim is to offer a comprehensive review of the state of the art of LYSO:Ce crystal products currently available on the market and identify the best producers for the BTL project. The performance of LYSO:Ce crystals have been evaluated using bare crystal samples (without wrapping) studying the following properties:  \n • mass density and correlation with Yttrium content;   \n• optical transmission characteristics and evaluation of the $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ relative concentration;   \n• photoluminescence characteristics;   \n• light output and decay time;   \n• light yield and decay time temperature dependency (low temperature range);   \n• 𝛾 radiation resistance.  \n 2 Samples  \n LYSO:Ce crystal samples from 12 manufacturers were studied and compared. A list of the manufacturers is provided below in alphabetic order. Each one is randomly associated with a number from 1 to 12 which identifies the producer’s crystals throughout this work. Therefore the id number does not match with the order in the following list.  \n • Crystal Photonics, U.S.A. • EPIC Crystal, China • Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan  \n • Hypercrystal–NSYSU, Taiwan   \n• Saint-Gobain, France   \n• Shanghai EBO Optoelectronics, China   \n• Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, China   \n• Simcrystals Technology, China   \n• SIPAT, China   \n• Suzhou JT Crystal Technology, China   \n• Tianle Photonics, China   \n• Zecotek Imaging System, Singapore  \n The LYSO:Ce $( [ \\mathbf { L } \\mathbf { u } _ { ( 1 - x ) } Y _ { x } ] _ { 2 } \\mathbf { S i O } _ { 5 } : \\mathbf { C e } )$ crystals analyzed have a variable Yttrium and Cerium content depending on the manufacturer. Both are related to fundamental properties of the crystals. The Yttrium content correlates with the mass density and consequently with the MIP deposited energy, while the Cerium content is related to light yield and decay time. Dedicated measurements were performed to determine Yttrium and $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ concentrations and are described in the following paragraphs.  \n 2.1 Sample description  \n The LYSO:Ce samples studied are $5 7 \\mathrm { m m }$ long crystal bars. The section is rectangular with 3 different thicknesses. The nominal dimensions are reported in table 1 for the 3 geometries. All manufacturers provided 15 crystal bars, 5 for each geometry and all cut from the same ingot. Samples were provided with an optical surface quality of $R a < 1 5 \\mathrm { { n m } }$ for all six faces. Most of the crystal properties were measured for all the samples of a manufacturer. When the set of crystals analyzed is smaller or with different characteristics, it is reported in detail. Figure 1 shows an example of a crystal bar sample (left) and a cross-sectional view of the 3 different available geometries (right).  \n Table 1. Nominal dimensions of the crystal bars. The bar width, thickness and length are labeled respectively as $w , t$ , and $L$ .  \n Table: Caption:  Body: <html><body><table><tr><td rowspan=\"2\">geometry type</td><td colspan=\"3\">bar dimension (mm)</td><td rowspan=\"2\"># of samples per producer</td></tr><tr><td>W</td><td>t</td><td>L</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3.12</td><td>3.75</td><td>57.00</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3.12</td><td>3.00</td><td>57.00</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3.12</td><td>2.40</td><td>57.00</td><td>5</td></tr></table></body></html> \n 2.2 Density of LYSO:Ce samples  \n The density of the LYSO:Ce bars is calculated based on the measurements of dimensions and mass. The crystal density is an indicator of the Yttrium percentage in the crystal composition, as shown later in this section, and is directly related to the amount of deposited energy by a Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) crossing the crystal.  \n Dimensions measurement. A high performance measurement system Mitutoyo LH-600 (figure 2(a)) was used to measure the three dimensions of the crystal bars. The digital resolution of the instrument is $1 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and the observed reproducibility of the measurement is $2 { - } 3 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The measurements were carried out on a flat granite table in a temperature controlled environment at $T \\sim 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ $( \\pm 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathbf { C } )$ .  \n For each single bar, width $( w )$ and thickness $( t )$ are defined as the average of 16 measurements in different positions along the crystal axis (figure 2(b)), while the length $( L )$ as the average of 8 measurements made in the $4 \\times 2$ corners of the ends of the bars, as shown in figure 2(c) . The black 3D printed holder, with holes of different transverse size, was used to support vertically the bar without any pressure on it and to avoid accidental falls. In figure 3 (left), $L$ is shown for all the crystal elements of producer 9. The data points and the error bars correspond to the average and the standard deviation of the 8 measurements performed to determine $L$ respectively. With the purpose to add information related to the compliance with the dimension specifications of the samples provided by each producer, the results are given showing the offsets defined as the difference between the measured values and the nominal values reported in table 1. Moreover, to characterize the uniformity of the samples, the offset values are averaged over the 15 crystals of each producer and the errors bars are the related standard deviations (figure 3, right). All the producers show a good mastering of the cutting technology. For almost all of them, the standard deviation of each dimension is within ${ 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ while the tolerance with respect to the nominal dimensions is within $3 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n  \n Mass measurements. The mass measurement of the crystal bars was performed with the highprecision Mettler Toledo XP105 balance $\\mathrm { 0 . 1 m g }$ digital resolution). The reproducibility of the measurements is better than $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m g }$ ; the balance is provided with a glass enclosure for protection against drafts (figure 2(d)). The measurements were carried out in a temperature controlled environment at $T \\sim 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ $( \\pm 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ . The mean values and the standard deviation of the measured bar masses are given in table 2 for each crystal geometry and for all the producers.  \n Density measurements. The density value is calculated by dividing the mass of the bar by its volume as calculated from the measured dimensions. The density uncertainty is obtained by the corresponding uncertainties on dimensions and mass (the latter being negligible). Results are summarized in figure 4 (left) where the density, between 7.0 and $7 . 4 \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ , is shown as the mean over the 15 crystals of the same producer. The error bar corresponds to the relative standard deviation (standard deviation over the mean) which is well below $1 \\%$ for all the producers.  \n Yttrium fraction with ICP-MS measurements and density correlation. The chemical formula of the Cerium-doped LYSO crystals of this study is $[ \\mathbf { L u } _ { ( 1 - x ) } \\mathbf { Y } _ { x } ] _ { 2 } \\mathbf { S i O } _ { 5 } : \\mathbf { C e }$ . The stoichiometry of $( [ \\mathrm { L u } _ { ( 1 - x ) } \\mathrm { Y } _ { x } ] )$ group is not fixed and depends on the crystal growth recipe of each manufacturer (expected values for x are below $1 0 \\%$ ). The large difference between the atomic mass of Lutetium (174.967 amu) and Yttrium (88.906 amu) leads to significant differences between the densities of LYSO crystals having different Yttrium content. The Yttrium molar fraction for at least one crystal bar from each producer was measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS, Aquila, Italy). For one of the producers, a set of  \n Table: Caption: Table 2. LYSO bar mass per crystal geometry and producer. The mean and the standard deviation of the mass values are reported for each geometry.

In total, 31 crystal bars were measured by the ICP-MS technique.  \n The results showing the Yttrium content and its linear correlation with the measured mass density are reported in figure 4 (right). Measurements from all the crystals of the subsample analyzed are shown and correspond to a data point. The linear correlation of the Yttrium fraction of a crystal bar with its density is clearly demonstrated and the linear regression coefficient is $R = 0 . 9 5$ . In addition, a linear fit with $\\chi ^ { 2 }$ minimization has been applied to the data. The linear fit parameters correspond, within the error, to the empirical linear relation of the Yttrium content and the density of the crystal which can be determined by the densities of pure LSO $( x = 0$ , density $\\underline { { \\mathbf { \\sigma } } } = 7 . 4 \\ : \\mathrm { g / c m } ^ { 3 } .$ ) and pure YSO $\\langle x = 1$ , density $= 4 . 5 \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 } .$ ) crystals.  \n 3 Optical properties  \n 3.1 Transmission  \n Transmission spectra were measured along the three directions of the crystal samples, one longitudinal $( L )$ and two transversal along width $( w )$ and thickness $\\mathbf { \\rho } ( t )$ . The measurements were performed at room temperature in the range $3 0 0 { - } 8 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . Figure 5 gives an example of transmission spectra measured for one crystal in all three directions. The figure shows on one side the reproducibility of the transmission measurement and on the other hand it illustrates the nature of the transmission threshold in the UV region. The transmission threshold is caused by the Cerium doping and not by the fundamental absorption of LYSO. Undoped LYSO crystals are indeed transparent in a wider range, with the fundamental absorption at $2 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ at room temperature [12].  \n The transverse dimensions of the samples $( 2 - 3 \\mathrm { m m } )$ did not allow for the study of the region below $3 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ due to saturating absorption on color centers induced by dopants (mainly Ce). Double beam spectrophotometers were used: P.E. Lambda 950 at CERN and UV–Vis–NIR CARY 5000 (Varian, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH) at NIMP Bucharest.  \n Although the sample dimensions were unsuitable (too thick) for a detailed analysis of the optical absorption, the spectra measured in the transverse directions ( $\\overset { \\cdot } { w }$ and $t$ ) allowed for the visualization of the $5 d ^ { 1 }$ absorption band of $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ and implicitly the evaluation of the relative Cerium concentration in the measured crystals. To this purpose, the absorbance spectra in the region of interest (ROI) from $4 4 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ down to $3 0 0 \\mathrm { n m } \\left( 2 . 8 – 4 . 1 \\mathrm { e V } \\right)$ were obtained from the transmission spectra (figure 5, zoom) and fitted using a function which takes into consideration the main absorption centers acting in that ROI. In the considered ROI, the absorbance is found to be proportional to the absorption coefficient $( \\alpha )$ and the sample transverse size $( d )$ :  \n $$\nA \\sim \\alpha \\cdot d\n$$ \n Details about how eq. 3.1 was analytically obtained by the transmission expression are provided in A.  \n The absorption coefficient can be decomposed into the sum of the contributions from different absorption centers $j$ , each one described by an absorption coefficient $\\alpha _ { j }$ , which is proportional to the concentration $N _ { j }$ of the respective absorption center:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle \\alpha = \\sum _ { j } \\alpha _ { j } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\mathrm { ~ w h e r e : ~ } \\alpha _ { j } = k _ { j } \\cdot N _ { j } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n In the defined ROI, $\\alpha$ can be written as:  \n $$\n\\alpha = \\alpha _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } } + \\alpha _ { \\mathrm { o t h e r } }\n$$ \n where $\\alpha _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } }$ represents the contribution of $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ absorption centers while $\\alpha _ { \\mathrm { o t h e r } }$ takes into account the contribution of all the other absorption centers.  \n The parameter $\\alpha _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } }$ is described by a Gaussian function of the energy. The amplitude of the Gaussian function is proportional to the concentration of Cerium in the sample. The absorption due to all the other absorbing centers $( \\alpha _ { \\mathrm { o t h e r } } )$ can be described by an empirical exponential function, similar to that applied in the Urbach approximation [13, 14]:  \n the ratio between the amplitude of the Gaussian function and the sample width can be used for a relative estimation of the concentration of $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ centers in the sample $( N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } } )$ . The fit function is effective for all the spectra, regardless of the Cerium doping and possible co-doping used by different crystal producers, as illustrated in figure 6.  \n Transmission spectra were measured for 39 crystals from different producers with at least two crystals from each producer. For producer 4, 5 and 6, samples from different ingots and with different declared Cerium concentration were studied. The corresponding $N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } }$ value are reported in table 3. A total of 23 crystals were measured in both transversal directions, $w$ and $t$ , and often more than one measurement was taken for a given direction, thus having a total of 75 optical transmission spectra analyzed. This was made in order to check both the reproducibility of the transmission spectrum measurement and the overall stability of the $( N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } } )$ measurement procedure.  \n Table: Caption: Table 3. $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ relative concentration $( N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } } )$ reported per crystal sample. The uncertainty of the $N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } }$ corresponds to the stability of the fit procedure $( 6 \\% )$ . In the last column of the table, information about the laboratory in which the measurement was performed is also given.

The overall measurement process stability, depending on the reliability of the fit function, was evaluated at the level of $6 \\%$ using the $N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } w , t }$ values obtained for crystals for which both the transverse spectra were available. In particular, it corresponds to the standard deviation of the distribution of $N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } w , t }$ divided by the corresponding average value over the two transverse spectra $ { \\langle N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } } \\rangle }$ .  \n $N _ { \\mathrm { C e ^ { 3 + } } }$ , as calculated from the absorption spectra, is expected to be correlated with the light yield and the scintillation kinetics expressing the characteristic decay time of the crystals. However, these parameters depend on many other factors that may alter their direct correlation with the concentration of Cerium in the crystal. Possible correlations between the relative concentration of $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ absorbing centers, $N _ { \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } }$ , calculated from the absorption spectra and scintillation parameters have been studied and the results are discussed in section 4.3.  \n 3.2 Photoluminescence  \n Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed for crystals of different producers using an Edimburgh Instruments FS5 Spectrofluorometer at ENEA Casaccia R.C.(Calliope facility lab) in the excitation range $2 4 0 { - } 3 9 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ and emission range $3 7 0 { - } 5 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . For the topics of interest in this article, only the emission spectra recorded in the range $3 7 0 { - } 5 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ by exciting the crystals with $\\lambda _ { \\mathrm { e x } } = 3 5 8 \\mathrm { n m }$ are reported. All the measurements were performed with $2 \\mathrm { n m }$ steps. The emission spectrum measurement reproducibility was found to be $1 \\%$ . The emission spectra for crystals from different producers, normalized to the maximum intensity value, are given in figure 7.  \n  \n The emission spectra have the same characteristic shape with two peaks at $4 2 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ and $3 9 6 \\mathrm { n m }$ for all the crystals but the ratio of the two peaks is quite different from one producer to another.  \n Table: Caption: Table 4. Relative emission intensity defined as $I _ { 4 2 0 } / I _ { 3 9 6 }$ for the crystals studied in the present work.

Crystals that exhibit a higher $I _ { 4 2 0 } / I _ { 3 9 6 }$ ratio have intrinsically a better light collection efficiency (for the same optical quality of the crystal surface and bulk purity). This is due to the smaller presence of the self-absorption mechanism in correspondence of the $4 2 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ peak with respect to the $3 9 6 \\mathrm { n m }$ peak region [15, 16].  \n As example, the emission spectrum weighted for the transmittance is shown in figure 8 for the same crystal $\\# 6 6$ . The resulting spectrum provides the information necessary to optimize the coupling of the crystals with the light detection sensor.  \n 4 Scintillation properties  \n The light output $( L O )$ and the decay time $( \\tau )$ of the crystal samples from each producer were measured with dedicated setup and methods at the INFN — Sezione di Roma and Sapienza University laboratory (Roma, Italy). The results are shown as the average values over the 15 samples of each producer. Details about the reproducibility of the measurements are provided.  \n $L O$ and $\\tau$ are key parameters for LYSO:Ce crystal timing applications. The highest possible $L O$ in the shortest possible time frame leads to the best timing performance for which a figure of merit can be defined as the ratio $L O / \\tau$ . Results for the figure of merit are also shown for all the producers.  \n Finally, the dependency of $L O$ and $\\tau$ on the relative $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ concentration has been investigated in section 4.3 with the aim to explore the possibility to use $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ concentration as a quality indicator of the scintillation and timing performance of the crystals.  \n 4.1 Experimental setup, methods and tools  \n Setup description. The experimental setup used for the measurement of the scintillation properties is shown in figure 9. It consists of a $5 1 \\mathrm { m m }$ diameter end window PMT (ET Enterprised model 9256B) placed inside a cylindrical box with a rectangular frame. The frame works as a guide to insert the bar holder which keeps the crystal bar vertical on the PMT photocathode window and is equipped with different transverse section holes for the housing of the 3 bar types. The crystal bars are inserted into the holder without any wrapping. One crystal end face is in contact with the PMT window while the other one is free and in contact with air. No grease is applied to enhance the PMT-crystal optical contact. This precaution was taken to optimize the reproducibility of the measurement. The setup is enclosed in a black painted box whose temperature is kept stable at $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ (within $0 . 1 { - } 0 . 2 \\ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ over $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ ) by the use of a chiller. The PMT signal is readout by the DRS4 evaluation board [17], working at a sampling rate of $2 \\mathrm { G S } / \\mathrm { s }$ ; this allows an integration window for the PMT signal extending up to $5 0 0 \\mathrm { n s }$ . The single photoelectron (SPE) response is calibrated using a pulsed, fast, blue LED. The LED light is brought inside the box using an optical fiber.  \n  \n Light output measurement. The absolute $L O$ measurement is performed using one of the annihilation photons emitted by a $^ { 2 2 } \\mathrm { N a }$ radioactive source placed beside the bar and evaluating the position of the $5 1 1 \\mathrm { k e V }$ photoelectron peak in the crystal signal. The charge of the photoelectron peak is then divided by the SPE charge and by the energy of the photon to obtain the $L O$ value expressed in photoelectrons per MeV of deposited energy.  \n SPE. The SPE charge value is extracted by fitting the charge spectra obtained with the LED with the convolution of a Poisson (accounting for gamma conversion process and first dynode photoelectron collection) and a Gauss distribution (accounting for multiplicative dynode system response), as shown in figure 10, top. In order to improve the fit stability, 5 charge spectra obtained with increasing LED pulses of different intensities are collected and simultaneously fitted leaving the SPE charge as common free parameter.  \n The PMT signal acquisition is triggered by the coincidence signal provided by the LED driver and the charge is integrated in a 30 ns window after the baseline subtraction.  \n 511 keV photo-peak. The charge associated to the $5 1 1 \\mathrm { k e V }$ photo-peak is obtained using a 17 parameter fit which fully describes the energy deposit of both the $5 1 1 \\mathrm { k e V }$ and the $1 2 7 5 \\mathrm { k e V }$ photons emitted by $^ { 2 2 } \\mathrm { N a }$ , including the contributions due to Compton, photo-electric and back-scatter interactions. A turn-on function is also used to describe the trigger behavior.  \n In this case the PMT signal acquisition is triggered on the PMT signal itself using an optimal threshold. The charge is integrated in a 450 ns time window after the baseline subtraction. An example of charge spectra used to extract the $5 1 1 \\mathrm { k e V }$ photo-peak values is presented together with the corresponding fitting functions in figure 10, bottom.  \n Decay time measurement. The acquisition with a fast sampling digitizer allows the extraction of the scintillation $\\tau$ directly from the acquired waveform of the PMT signal. An average over all PMT signals with an associated total charge above roughly $1 0 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ in the $^ { 2 2 } \\mathrm { N a }$ runs is performed. The average waveform is passed through a Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of $2 0 \\mathrm { M H z }$ to reduce oscillations due the imperfect impedance matching between the PMT anode output and the DRS4 buffer input. $\\tau$ is extracted from a fit which includes a single exponential decay function and a Gaussian turn-on. An example of this fit is shown in figure 11. From the average waveform it is also possible to estimate the amount of light emitted in a time window smaller than $4 5 0 \\mathrm { n s }$ , integrating the waveform in different time windows.  \n The reproducibility of the $L O$ and $\\tau$ measurements was estimated repeating them daily over one month using a reference crystal and it was found to be $4 \\%$ and better than $1 \\%$ , respectively.  \n 4.2 Measurement results  \n The $L O$ and $\\tau$ measurement results are averaged over the 15 crystals provided by each producer and are displayed in figure 12. The $L O$ (figure 12, top) is expressed in photons/MeV and represents the number of scintillation photons produced per MeV of energy deposit which impinge on the photosensor and are successfully detected. It is corrected for the quantum efficiency of the sensor and corresponds to the intrinsic crystal light yield (LY) times the light collection efficiency (LCE). The latter depends on the optical surface quality of the crystal and the transparency of the bulk as well as the crystal-sensor coupling (which is, however, the same for all the crystals). The quantum efficiency correction factor is obtained by the quantum efficiency of the PMT, as provided by the producer, weighted over the LYSO spectrum and corresponds to about $2 5 \\%$ .  \n The relative standard deviation of the $L O$ values for different producers is about $8 \\%$ . The $L O$ standard deviation (error bars in figure 12, top) for samples of the same producer is mostly comparable with the reproducibility of the measurement $( 4 \\% )$ , although some show higher values revealing a less uniform $L O$ among the provided samples. The standard deviation value of producer 1 can be explained by 2 outlier crystals.  \n  \n The $\\tau$ value ranges from 45 down to 38 ns for the slowest to the fastest crystal, as illustrated in figure 12, bottom. The relative standard deviation of the $\\tau$ values for different producers is about $5 \\%$ while the relative standard deviation for crystals from the same producer is around $1 \\%$ and thus comparable with the reproducibility of the measurement. Finally, figure 13 shows the figure of merit $L O / \\tau$ for the timing performance for each producer. The relative standard deviation of the values from different producers is within $5 \\%$ .  \n 4.3 Study of the main scintillation parameters as a function of $\\mathbf { C e ^ { 3 + } }$ relative concentration  \n Figures 14 and 15 show $\\tau$ and $L O$ as a function of the $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ relative concentration calculated as described in section 3.1. The linear dependence between $\\tau$ and $L O$ and the calculated $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ relative concentration is too weak to recommend the use of the latter for an indirect assessment of the first two parameters i.e. the scintillation performance of crystals. In particular, while the $\\tau$ trend with respect to $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ relative concentration is close to the expectation of linear correlation, for the $L O$ the linear dependency hypothesis is weaker.  \n The scintillation performance of LYSO:Ce crystals depends on several factors, not only the intensity of the optical absorption peak at $3 6 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , which represents the standard indicator for the concentration of $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ absorbing centers (i.e. concentration of Cerium used as scintillation activator). First of all, the intensity of the absorption peak at $3 6 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ reflects only the content of $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ [18, 19] while the content of $\\mathrm { C e ^ { 4 + } }$ , which has an important contribution to the scintillation $L O$ , remains unknown. The ratio between the $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ and ${ \\mathrm { C e } } ^ { 4 + }$ concentrations depends on possible co-doping applied by each crystal producer and also on unintentional impurities and defects.  \n As mentioned above, the samples are too thick for measuring the broad band in the UV region which may possibly give a hint on the $\\mathrm { C e ^ { 3 + } / C e ^ { 4 + } }$ concentrations ratio. Furthermore, the light yield depends on the competition between radiative and non-radiative recombination. This competition might be strongly affected by co-doping and unintentional impurities due to different raw materials used by different crystal producers.  \n On the basis of these arguments, the results in figure 14 and 15 can be explained as a milder sensitivity of $\\tau$ to the presence of other dopants and impurities or defects with respect to the one exhibited by the $L O$ . Co-doping, defects and impurities depend indeed by the specific LYSO:Ce recipe and growing process chosen by each manufacturer.  \n 5 𝜸 radiation hardness  \n Radiation hardness of the crystal samples against ionizing radiation by $\\gamma$ rays was studied at the Calliope facility of ENEA-Casaccia Research Centre (Rome, Italy). Calliope is a pool-type facility equipped with a $^ { 6 0 } \\mathrm { C o }$ radio-isotopic source array in a large volume shielded cell [20]. The irradiation tests involved at least one crystal bar of type 2 for each producer. All the samples were irradiated at the same dose rate of $9 \\mathrm { { k G y / h } }$ and received a total integrated absorbed dose of $5 0 \\mathrm { k G y } .$ The dose rate value is experimentally measured by an alanine-ESR dosimetric system mapping the Calliope irradiation area. The dose rate uncertainty is $5 \\%$ .  \n  \n 5.1 Scintillation properties  \n All the irradiated samples were measured before and after the irradiation with the setup described in section 4.1.  \n After irradiation, all the crystals exhibited phosphorescence light with an approximate decay time of $2 { - } 3 \\mathrm { h }$ as estimated from the presence of a transient noise in the baseline of the PMT signal acquired $\\sim$ every hour for $1 2 \\mathrm { h }$ , displayed in figure 16. For this reason, the samples were measured again at least $1 6 \\mathrm { h }$ after the irradiation to evaluate the ratio of the $L O$ and the $\\tau$ after and before irradiation. The results are shown in figure 17. The average light output loss amounts to $9 \\%$ with a relative standard deviation of $3 \\%$ among the different producers (figure 17, top). The scintillation $\\tau$ (figure 17, bottom) after irradiation remains unchanged within the measurement uncertainties compared to the pre-irradiation value for most of the producers. The average ratio of $\\tau$ after and before the irradiation is $1 \\%$ with a standard deviation of $2 \\%$ .  \n In general, the scintillation mechanism of LYSO:Ce is not damaged by $\\gamma$ -ray irradiation [21]. The $L O$ decrease depends on the $\\gamma$ -induced transparency loss which is due to the creation of absorbing centers. The $L O$ can be further recovered through a air annealing of the crystal at $\\sim 3 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for some hours. Slow (few days) spontaneous recovery can also be observed at room temperature [18].  \n 6 Scintillation properties at low temperature  \n Due to its radiation hardness against photons and hadrons, LYSO:Ce can be employed for timing purposes in the harsh environment of the new generation particle colliders such as the HL-LHC. Here, to mitigate the impact of the radiation damage on the performance of the detector components, especially the silicon ones, the operating temperature is usually lowered below $0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ by some tens of degrees. This will be, for example, the case of the barrel part of the timing detector of CMS-phase II. In BTL, LYSO crystals are coupled to Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPM). Radiation exposure increases the noise due to the SiPM dark count rate and lowers the $L O$ of the crystals deteriorating the time resolution. For this reason the detector will be operated at low temperature, between $- 4 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $- 3 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .  \n With the aim to extend and complete the set of information collected in this paper, additional measurements of $L O$ and $\\tau$ in this range of temperatures for crystal bars from each of the 12 producers were performed. The experimental setup and the results are presented in this section.  \n 6.1 Experimental setup  \n The experimental bench used for cold measurements of LYSO:Ce crystal is shown in figure 18. It features the same concept of the PMT bench used in the crystal characterization campaign at room temperature $( 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ and described in section 4. Also the methods and the analysis tools to obtain the values of $L O$ (expressed in photoelectrons per $\\mathrm { M e V }$ of deposited energy) and $\\tau$ are the same. The $L O$ value is corrected for the temperature dependency of the PMT gain using the charge of the SPE measured at the same temperature with the LED. The same LED runs have been used to exclude a non-negligible dependency of the PMT quantum efficiency (QE) on temperature. This was obtained verifying that the average number of photoelectrons in a LED run (LED intensity set to give an average number of photoelectrons $\\simeq 1$ ) remains constant with the temperature. To reach and stabilize the temperature down to $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , the setup was enclosed into a thermostatic chamber (Angelantoni TY110) and equipped with a temperature monitor. The temperature fluctuations during a standard data taking have been measured and found to be $\\pm 0 . 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . In a preliminary study, the response of the PMT used (Hamamatsu R7378) was measured and proved to be linear down to $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The PMT signal is brought outside the chamber through a circular feedthrough and readout by a 12 bit $3 . 2 \\mathrm { G S } / \\mathrm { s }$ digitizer (CAEN DT5743). The reproducibility of the $L O$ and the $\\tau$ measurement was evaluated repeating several times the corresponding measurements using a reference crystal and it was found to be $2 \\%$ and $< 1 \\%$ , respectively. The better performance in term of $L O$ measurement reproducibility of this test bench with respect to the one used for the measurements described in section 4.1 is probably due to the better temperature stabilization provided by the high performance thermostatic chamber in which the setup was enclosed.  \n 6.2 Results  \n At least one crystal bar of the smallest geometry for each of the 12 producers was measured. Six measurement points have been acquired with temperatures ranging from $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ down to $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Lowering the temperature, both the $L O$ and $\\tau$ increase slowly. In figure 19 (top) an example of $L O$ as a function of the temperature and normalized to the corresponding value at $T = 2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ is shown.  \n The $L O$ is linear with the temperature for all producers. The temperature coefficient is on average $- 0 . 1 5 \\% / { } ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ranging between $- 0 . 2 8 \\ : \\% / ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $- 0 . 0 8 \\ : \\% / ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ as shown in figure 19 (bottom). The $L O$ relative variation as a function of the temperature is equal to the light yield (LY) relative variation because the $L O$ can be factorized as $\\mathrm { L Y } \\times \\mathrm { L C E } \\times \\mathrm { Q E }$ and the LCE and the QE can be assumed constant with the temperature and therefore cancel out in the ratio.  \n  \n $\\tau$ dependency on the temperature is linear down to $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ only for 6 producers over 12 (regression coefficient $\\mathrm { R > 0 . 8 5 }$ ) and in general the variation with temperature is smaller than for the $L O$ . In figure 20 (top) the linear dependency of $\\tau$ for producer 5 is shown as an example. For the other producers, no linear relation between the temperature and $\\tau$ can be assumed $( \\mathrm { R } < 0 . 7 5 )$ . In figure 20 (bottom), $\\tau$ vs. $T$ is shown for crystals from this subset of producers; in particular for producer 2  \n $( R = 0 . 4 1 )$ ), 4 $R = 0 . 7 3 )$ and 7 $R = 0 . 7 6 )$ ). For these producers, additional measurement points at low temperature would be needed for a more rigorous description of $\\tau$ dependency down to $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ .  \n In figure 21 the ratio of the figure of merit $( L O / \\tau )$ measured at $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and at $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ is also shown. Its average value and standard deviation are 1.05 and 0.02 respectively. For all producers the ratio is ${ > } 1$ . This demonstrates that lowering the operating temperature of the crystal can help to improve their timing performance.  \n 7 Discussion  \n A set of 15 small crystal bars $( 3 m m \\times 3 m m \\times 5 7 m m )$ from 12 different producers were studied and compared with respect to a set of properties and performance fundamental for HEP applications with a special focus on timing applications.  \n All producers are shown to have mastered the cutting technology producing samples with uniform dimensions at the level of per mille, and within the requested specifications at a level better than $1 \\%$ . From the dimensions and the mass measurement, the crystal density value was derived for every sample. It ranges from 7.1 to $7 . 4 \\mathrm { g } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 3 }$ and its relative standard deviation among the samples of the same producer is well below $1 \\%$ .  \n The mass density study is complemented, for at least one crystal per producer, by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements from which the Yttrium molar fraction was evaluated. The Yttrium fraction is indeed expected to linearly correlate with the mass density. The expectation has been confirmed by data $R = 0 . 9 5$ ) and the spread of the Yttrium fraction among the different producers is about $30 \\%$ .  \n Optical transmission spectra and photoluminescence properties were also studied for all producers. In particular, the evaluation of the relative concentration of the main crystal luminescence center $( \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } )$ was obtained from the transmission spectra. Its correlation with the light output $( L O )$ and decay time $( \\tau )$ of the crystals has been investigated in the attempt to establish a method to characterize the timing performance of the crystals. The data do not match the expectations showing a poor linear correlation of the $( \\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + } )$ relative concentration with both scintillation parameters. This has been mainly ascribed to the possible presence of different co-dopants, impurities and defects which may have an important role in the scintillation dynamics.  \n  \n $L O$ and $\\tau$ were measured for all the crystal samples, together with the figure of merit for timing application defined as $L O / \\tau$ . all producers’ samples show similar scintillation properties. The spread of the $L O$ value for different producers is at the level of $8 \\%$ while for $\\tau$ , ranging from 38 to $4 5 \\mathrm { n s }$ , it is within $5 \\%$ . The uniformity of the crystal samples provided by each producer with respect to these scintillation parameters is comparable with the reproducibility of the measurements: $4 \\%$ for the $L O$ and $1 \\%$ for $\\tau$ .  \n In order to test the radiation hardness of the crystal samples against $\\gamma$ , $L O$ and $\\tau$ were also measured after irradiation with $5 0 \\mathrm { k G y }$ at a dose rate of $9 \\mathrm { k G y / h }$ for a subsample of crystals from all 12 producers. While $\\tau$ remains essentially unchanged for all producers, the $L O$ loss is on average at the level of $10 \\%$ . The study did not include a thermal annealing campaign. Nevertheless it is a well established concept that the $L O$ damage is not permanent and it can be fully recovered by thermal annealing.  \n Finally, the $L O$ and $\\tau$ dependency on temperature was analyzed for a subsample of crystals down to $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The $L O$ exhibits a linear dependency on temperature with a temperature coefficient ranging between $- 0 . 2 8 \\ : \\% / ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $- 0 . 0 8 \\ : \\% / ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Only 6 producer over 12 shows a linear $\\tau$ dependency on the temperature down to $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . More data points at low temperature would be needed to study the non-linearity of $\\tau$ for the other producers.  \n Nevertheless, the figure of merit at $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ compared with the results obtained at $2 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ shows that lowering the operating temperature of the crystals can help to improve their timing performance. This holds true for all the producers and with a relative standard deviation of $\\simeq 2 \\%$ .  \n The most important crystal features measured in this study are summarized in table 5 and table 6 for each producer. All producers showed similar characteristics within $\\simeq 1 0 \\%$ , except for the $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ relative concentration and the LY temperature coefficient. For these crystal properties the spread among the producers is at the level of $5 0 \\%$ . Despite this, their impact on the key performance for HEP and especially for timing application is limited. The $\\mathrm { C e } ^ { 3 + }$ relative concentration has shown a poor correlation with LO and $\\tau$ while the spread in the LY temperature coefficients does not reflect in the figure of merit $\\mathrm { L Y } / \\tau$ .  \n 8 Conclusions  \n A comprehensive and systematic study of LYSO:Ce $[ \\mathrm { L } \\mathbf { u } _ { ( 1 - x ) } \\mathbf { Y } _ { x } ] _ { 2 } \\mathrm { S i O } _ { 5 } : \\mathrm { C e } )$ crystals is presented. It involves for the first time a large number of crystal samples (180) of the same size from several producers. The study consists of a comparative characterization of LYSO:Ce crystal products available on the market and aims, in particular, to investigate key parameters of timing applications for HEP.  \n A set of 15 small crystal bars $( 3 \\mathrm { m m } \\times 3 \\mathrm { m m } \\times 5 7 \\mathrm { m m } )$ for each producer were measured with respect to mechanical, optical and scintillation properties. The latter were studied before and after the irradiation of the crystals with a $5 0 \\mathrm { k G y }$ integrated dose of $\\gamma$ -ray and at temperatures down to $- 3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . The timing performance of the crystals was evaluated by a figure of merit defined as $L O / \\tau$ .  \n Table: Caption: Table 5.

INTRODUCTION  \n A sub-terahertz accelerator (A-STAR) is being developed at Argonne National Laboratory to reduce the cost and footprint of a future hard x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facility [1,2]. A-STAR is a collinear wakefield accelerator (CWA) that uses a cylindrical corrugated waveguide (CWG) as a slow-wave structure, analogous to other CWA configurations [3–8] and drive beam decelerator in CLIC [9]. In operation, a high-charge drive electron bunch passing through the CWA generates an electromagnetic field, known as the wakefield, which accelerates a low charge witness electron bunch following close behind the drive bunch. The ratio of the maximum electric field behind the drive bunch to the maximum electric field within the bunch is known as the transformer ratio $\\mathcal { R }$ and is limited to 2 for symmetric drive bunches [10]. The A-STAR design uses a 10-nC asymmetrical drive bunch [10,11] to achieve a transformer ratio of 5 and an accelerating gradient of $9 0 \\ \\mathrm { M V } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ , where the accelerating field is a $1 8 0 – \\mathrm { G H z }$ $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode propagating with a group velocity of $0 . 5 7 c$ , where $c$ is the speed of light. The accelerator ends when the drive bunch exhausts almost all of its energy at which point the witness bunch reaches a maximum energy approaching $\\mathcal { E } _ { 0 } ( 1 + \\mathcal { R } )$ , where $\\mathcal { E } _ { 0 }$ is the initial energy of the beam. The entire CWA is composed of many $0 . 5 \\mathrm { - m }$ long modules connected in series, as shown in Fig. 1.  \n  \n The CWA is driven directly by an electron bunch propagating through the structure, making it operationally different from conventional iris loaded linac structures driven by external rf sources. The overall short duration of the rf pulse behind the drive bunch is expected to reduce the rf breakdown rate in the CWG while the growing length of the pulse with distance causes power dissipation in the wall material to increase along the length of the accelerator module. Understanding these effects is critical to the design of a high repetition rate CWA and they will be discussed further in Secs. V and VI. Creating a large accelerating gradient with a 10-nC drive electron bunch requires the inner radius of the CWG to be small, while manufacturing limitations at the resulting scale require the corrugations/ irises to be shallow. These constraints cause the CWG slowwave structure to have higher group velocity and peak surface fields than iris loaded structures commonly found in the literature. In this paper, we investigate 1-mm inner radius CWG geometries that attempt to minimize power dissipation and peak surface fields, maximizing the bunch repetition rate and accelerating gradient of the CWA. We also attempt to minimize coupling to higher order modes (HOMs) which is the preferred operating condition according to [12]. Using the eigenmode and wakefield solvers in CST Microwave Studio [13], we parametrically characterize a range of corrugation geometries to arrive at the final design of the A-STAR CWG presented in Sec. VIII. Fabrication and testing of the CWG are described in [14] and the vacuum properties of the structure are discussed in [15]. Parameters and variables used throughout paper are given in Table I.  \n  \n II. CORRUGATION GEOMETRY  \n The CWG is a round metallic pipe with grooves around the inner circumference of the wall as shown in Fig. 2. The minor radius, $a$ , of the CWG is the distance between the center axis of the waveguide and the tips of the corrugation teeth. Here, we refer to the raised part of the profile as the corrugation tooth and the space between adjacent teeth as the vacuum gap. The radii of the tooth tip and vacuum gap floor are connected by a flat surface called the sidewall and the overall dimensions of the corrugation are small compared to the minor radius $a$ . The shape of the corrugation tooth determines the peak fields and thermal properties of the structure and must be optimized to obtain the maximum accelerating gradient. Figure 3 shows three types of tooth geometries considered in this paper. Each type is a subset of a trapezoidal corrugation with rounded corners, where we have created three separate categories to simplify the presentation of the results.  \n The first profile is the rectangular corrugation with minimum radii corners Fig. 3(a) which has vertical sidewalls and sharp corners. In this analysis, the corners were given a radius of $r _ { t } = r _ { g } = a / 1 0 0$ to produce accurate simulation results for the peak surface fields which become very large as the corner radius shrinks. The minimum radii geometry has three degrees of freedom, namely the corrugation tooth width $t$ , vacuum gap $g$ , and depth $d$ . Increasing the corner radius results in the maximum radii profile as shown in Fig. 3(b), which has the same three degrees of freedom but a corner radius as large as possible while preserving the overall depth and period of the profile. Here, $r _ { t } = r _ { g } = \\operatorname* { m i n } ( t , g , d ) / 2$ , where the min function returns its minimum argument. The final corrugation is the rounded profile with unequal radii tooth tip and vacuum gap, Fig. 3(c). This profile has 4 degrees of freedom: the corrugation period $p$ , corrugation depth $d$ , maximum tooth width $t$ , and maximum vacuum gap $g$ . Here, $t = 2 r _ { t }$ and $g = 2 r _ { g }$ where $\\boldsymbol { r } _ { t }$ and $r _ { g }$ are the radii of the tooth tip and vacuum gap contours, respectively. The profile is drawn by connecting the fully rounded corrugation tooth tip and vacuum gap with an inner tangent line, allowing the sidewall angle to vary.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I.

The sidewall parameter $\\zeta$ controls the sidewall angle of the unequal radii profile, where $\\zeta < 1$ leads to tapered sidewalls and $\\zeta > 1$ leads to undercut sidewalls. These dependencies are illustrated in Fig. 4.  \n The condition for vertical sidewalls is $\\zeta = 1$ and $d > p / 2$ . Preventing a self-intersecting geometry requires both the width of the tooth and vacuum gap to be less than the corrugation period, as well as a sufficiently large corrugation depth when $\\zeta > 1$ to ensure positive length of the inner tangent line defining the sidewall. These conditions can be expressed as  \n $$\n\\zeta - 2 < \\xi < 2 - \\zeta ,\n$$ \n $$\nd > { \\frac { p } { 2 } } \\left( \\zeta + { \\sqrt { \\zeta ^ { 2 } - 1 } } \\right) \\quad { \\mathrm { f o r ~ } } \\zeta > 1 .\n$$ \n III. SIMULATION  \n Electromagnetic simulation of the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ accelerating mode was performed using the eigenmode solver in CST  \n Microwave Studio [13]. In this analysis, only the fundamental $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode was considered since it accounts for the largest portion of the accelerating gradient. It will be shown in Sec. VII that the exclusion of higher order modes (HOMs) is a very good approximation for the corrugated structures under consideration. A tetrahedral mesh and magnetic symmetry planes were used to accurately model the rounded corners of the corrugation and minimize computation time. Since the simulation only considers a single period of the geometry, the run time was short (approximately $1 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ on a four-core desktop PC) allowing large parametric sweeps to be run rapidly. The eigenmode solver models the corrugated waveguide as a periodic structure of infinite length by employing a periodic boundary condition derived from beam-wave synchronicity:  \n $$\n\\phi = \\frac { 3 6 0 f p } { c } ,\n$$ \n where $\\phi$ is the periodic boundary condition phase advance in degrees, $f$ is the frequency of the electromagnetic mode, $p$ is the corrugation period, and $c$ is the speed of light. The electron bunch velocity is considered to be equal to $c$ .  \n The structures were simulated at three fixed frequencies in order to characterize frequency-dependent behavior of the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode. Throughout the paper, we will refer to results for the simulated frequencies by their respective aperture ratios which we define as $a / \\lambda$ , where $a$ is the minor radius of the CWG and $\\lambda$ is the free-space wavelength of the synchronous mode. This normalization allows the results to be applied to structures of any size and frequency.  \n  \n Parametric analysis began by treating the corrugation depth $d$ as a dependent variable determined by the aperture ratio, eliminating it from the parameter sweeps. This was done by using an iterative optimization process to find the corrugation depths required to achieve predetermined frequencies, producing aperture ratios of 0.53, 0.60, and 0.67 for each combination of $p , \\xi$ , and $\\zeta$ in the study. The resulting corrugation depths are plotted in Figs. 5 and 6. In all cases, the corrugation depth decreases with increasing aperture ratio, where shallower corrugations produce higher synchronous $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ frequencies. The sidewall parameter $\\zeta$ is found to modify the effective corrugation depth where reducing $\\zeta$ has an effect similar to reducing $d$ . Undercut corrugation profiles with $\\zeta > 1$ can only be found when the conditions in Eqs. (3) and (4) are satisfied which requires the period and aperture ratio to be sufficiently small. For this reason, the dotted line solutions in Fig. 6 only occur above the set values of the corrugation depth. In the remainder of the analysis, we will pay special attention to the maximum radii corrugation and unequal radii corrugation with $\\zeta = 1$ which are good candidates for wakefield acceleration due to their manufacturability and electromagnetic characteristics.  \n  \n IV. ELECTROMAGNETIC PARAMETERS  \n Each synchronous eigenmode solution of the periodic structure is characterized by a wakefield loss factor $\\kappa$ , group velocity $v _ { g } ,$ and attenuation constant $\\alpha$ . These parameters determine how the electron beam interacts with the given mode as well as the propagation characteristics of the corresponding wakefield. In this section, equations for the electromagnetic parameters are defined and applied to the structures found in Sec. III. The results are plotted against the corrugation spacing parameter $\\xi$ and period $p$ at each of the three aperture ratios to show how the wave propagation and beam interaction depend on the corrugation geometry and frequency. The loss factor $\\kappa$ describes the energy coupled from a charged particle to the structure and is defined as [16]:  \n $$\n\\kappa = \\frac { V ^ { 2 } / U } { 4 ( 1 - \\beta _ { g } ) p } ,\n$$ \n where $V$ is the induced voltage, $U$ is the stored energy in the unit cell, and $\\beta _ { g }$ is the normalized group velocity $v _ { g } / c$ . The induced voltage is calculated from the time harmonic electric field of the synchronous mode with angular frequency $\\omega$ as  \n $$\nV = \\Biggl | \\int _ { 0 } ^ { p } E _ { z } ( z ) e ^ { j \\omega _ { c } ^ { z } } d z \\Biggr | .\n$$ \n The group velocity ${ \\boldsymbol { v } } _ { g }$ is calculated from the time averaged electromagnetic field power flow $P _ { z }$ , the unit cell length $p$ , and the stored energy $U$ in the unit cell, where $P _ { z }$ is found by integration of the Poynting vector,  \n $$\nv _ { g } = \\frac { P _ { z } } { U } p .\n$$ \n Loss in the structure due to the conductivity of the wall material causes the fields to decay as $\\exp ( - \\alpha z )$ , where the attenuation constant $\\alpha$ in $\\mathrm { { N p m ^ { - 1 } } }$ is calculated in terms of the quality factor $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ of the unit cell as [17]:  \n $$\n\\alpha = \\frac { \\omega } { 2 Q v _ { g } } .\n$$ \n Figure 7 shows how the electromagnetic parameters of the maximum radii corrugation depend on the geometry for a CWG with minor radius $a = 1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and electrical conductivity $\\sigma = 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { 7 } ~ \\mathrm { { S m ^ { - 1 } } }$ . The scaling laws derived in Appendix A can be used to project the results to cases with different $a$ and $\\sigma$ . The loss factor $\\kappa$ and group velocity $\\beta _ { g }$ have similar behavior which can be explained in part by the appearance of $( 1 - \\beta _ { g } )$ in the denominator of Eq. (6). This dependence results in a reduction of $\\kappa$ as the corrugation period increases since $\\beta _ { g }$ goes to zero as the phase advance $\\phi$ approaches the $\\pi$ point of the dispersion curve. Structures with shorter corrugation periods, therefore, produce larger group velocities and wake potentials making it desirable to choose the period as short as possible. As the period shrinks, $\\kappa$ approaches a maximum value, which for a single moded steeply corrugated structure with $d \\gtrsim p$ is [18]:  \n $$\n\\kappa _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } = \\frac { Z _ { 0 } c } { 2 \\pi a ^ { 2 } } ,\n$$ \n where $Z _ { 0 }$ is the impedance of free space. In practical corrugated waveguide designs, the loss factor is always less than $\\kappa _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ due to manufacturing constraints on the minimum corrugation size. In these structures, simulations are required to accurately determine the loss factor.  \n V. PEAK FIELD MINIMIZATION  \n The maximum attainable accelerating gradient in the CWA is limited by several factors, including pulse heating and rf breakdown due to the peak surface fields and modified Poynting vector [19–21] exceeding certain threshold values. The corrugated waveguide must be optimized to maximize the accelerating field of the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode while minimizing these factors. Data collected from existing accelerator structures operating up to $3 0 \\mathrm { G H z }$ show that the breakdown rate (BDR), measured in breakdowns per pulse per meter, scales approximately with the magnitude of the peak electromagnetic field $E _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ as well as the duration of the rf pulse $t _ { p }$ according to [21]:  \n  \n $$\n\\frac { E _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ^ { 3 0 } t _ { p } ^ { 5 } } { \\mathrm { B D R } } = \\mathrm { c o n s t . }\n$$ \n From a design perspective, reducing the BDR is achieved by reducing the peak surface fields and the pulse length. Calculation of the absolute threshold value of the fields that induce breakdown in sub-THz structures is an active area of research [19,22,23] and reliable models have not yet been developed. The modified Poynting vector introduced in [21] has been used to predict rf breakdown in structures operating up to $3 0 ~ \\mathrm { G H z }$ , but there are limited data for its applicability at higher frequencies. For this reason, the BDR and maximum gradient of the CWA must ultimately be determined experimentally. For the purpose of optimization, we choose the peak surface fields $E _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ and $H _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ as figures of merit which should be minimized to increase the attainable accelerating gradient. Since some evidence suggests that pulse heating is of fundamental importance to the initiation of rf breakdown in high frequency accelerating structures [24], we give additional weight to the minimization of the peak magnetic surface field. This choice leads to a higher overall thermal efficiency which will be discussed further in Sec. VI.  \n In evaluating the peak surface fields for the various corrugation geometries, we have normalized the fields over the accelerating gradient given in Eq. (B29) in Appendix B to allow a comparison of the results. Typical electric and magnetic field distributions within the corrugation unit cell are shown in Fig. 8, where the electric field is generally concentrated around the tooth tip and the magnetic field is highest in the vacuum gap.  \n  \n The simulation results in Figs. 9 and 10 show that the peak electric and magnetic fields always increase with increasing aperture ratio, meaning higher choices of frequency for the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ synchronous mode result in higher peak fields for a given accelerating gradient. This observation is consistent with the results reported in [25] and is seen in unequal radii geometries as well. Unlike the rounded geometries, the peak fields of the minimum radii rectangular geometry shown in Fig. 9 have a strong dependence on the corrugation period and higher overall values due to field enhancement at the corrugation corners. At a period of $p / a = 0 . 4$ , the peak electric fields of the minimum radii geometry are roughly double those of the rounded designs making minimum radii rectangular corrugations unsuitable for high gradient CWA structures.  \n Comparing the maximum radii and unequal radii rounded corrugation peak fields in Figs. 10 and 11, we note that the two geometry types are identical when the spacing parameter $\\xi = 0$ and the sidewall parameter $\\zeta = 1$ . In both structure types, the minimum $E _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ occurs for a negative spacing parameter $\\xi$ , corresponding to a corrugation tooth width wider than the vacuum gap. Increasing the corrugation spacing beyond the minimum point decreases $H _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ while increasing $E _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ . The sidewall angle determined by $\\zeta$ shifts the plots on the $\\xi$ axis but does not significantly affect the minimum value of the peak fields. While changing the sidewall parameter offers little to no benefit in reducing the peak fields, the practical implications of using values of $\\zeta \\neq 1$ have several disadvantages. For tapered corrugations with $\\zeta < 1$ , the corrugation depth must be greater requiring a thicker vacuum chamber wall and additional manufacturing complexity. Undercut corrugations with $\\zeta > 1$ are also impractical to manufacture for the dimensions of interest in a compact wakefield accelerator. For these reasons, we suggest the maximum radii corrugation with $\\xi$ close to zero as a good candidate for a wakefield accelerator design. Further refinement of the geometry requires experimental determination of where rf breakdown is most likely to occur in order to reduce the peak fields in those regions.  \n  \n VI. THERMAL LOADING  \n Thermal loading of the corrugated waveguide places a limit on the maximum repetition rate $f _ { r }$ of the accelerator, where $f _ { r }$ is the number of bunches injected into the structure per second. The thermal loading depends on the electromagnetic properties of the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode as well as the length of the corrugated waveguide and the conductivity of the wall material. Achieving a high repetition rate requires active cooling of the structure as well as an optimally designed corrugation profile. Here we focus on designing a corrugation that minimizes the steady-state thermal load and transient pulse heating. The thermally induced stresses due to temperature gradients in the wall pose additional design considerations which are discussed further in [26].  \n Because the group velocity $v _ { g }$ of the electromagnetic wave is less than the electron bunch velocity, the length of the rf pulse behind the bunch grows as it traverses the structure. This causes the thermal energy density deposited in the CWG wall to increase along the direction of propagation. At a distance $z$ from the beginning of the CWG, the field strength of the rf pulse induced by the electron bunch entering at time $t = 0$ is  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle P ^ { 1 / 2 } ( z , t ) = \\sqrt { \\frac { 2 \\kappa q _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } | F | ^ { 2 } v _ { g } } { 1 - \\beta _ { g } } } e ^ { \\frac { - \\alpha ( v _ { g } t - \\beta _ { g } z ) } { 1 - \\beta _ { g } } } \\cos { \\left[ \\omega \\left( t - \\frac { z } { c } \\right) \\right] } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\times \\Pi \\bigg ( \\frac { 2 v _ { g } t - z ( 1 + \\beta _ { g } ) } { 2 z ( 1 - \\beta _ { g } ) } \\bigg ) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Here the field strength is defined in units of $\\sqrt { \\mathrm { W } }$ for consistency with the units provided by CST simulation, $F$ is the bunch form factor derived in Appendix B, $q _ { 0 }$ is the drive bunch charge, and $\\Pi ( x )$ is the rectangular window function.  \n $$\n\\Pi ( x ) = { \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l l } { 1 } & { | x | < 1 / 2 } \\\\ { 0 } & { { \\mathrm { e l s e } } } \\end{array} \\right. }\n$$ \n The derivative of the one-dimensional energy dissipation distribution $Q _ { \\mathrm { d i s s } } ( z )$ along the corrugated structure is obtained by multiplying $P$ from Eq. (12) by the attenuation constant $\\alpha$ and integrating the product over time from $t = 0$ to $t = \\infty$ giving  \n $$\n\\frac { d Q _ { \\mathrm { d i s s } } ( z ) } { d z } = \\frac { E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } ^ { 2 } } { 4 \\kappa } ( 1 - e ^ { - 2 \\alpha z } ) ,\n$$ \n where we have made the substitution $E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } = 2 \\kappa q _ { 0 } | \\boldsymbol { F } |$ as derived in Appendix B. The total energy dissipated in the CWG of the length $L$ is obtained by integrating Eq. (14) over the length $L$ giving  \n $$\nQ _ { \\mathrm { d i s s } } = \\frac { E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } ^ { 2 } } { 8 \\alpha \\kappa } ( e ^ { - 2 \\alpha L } + 2 \\alpha L - 1 ) .\n$$ \n According to Eq. (14), the amount of energy deposited on the CWG wall per unit length reaches a maximum after the electron bunch propagates a distance $z \\gg 1 / \\alpha$ . It is further convenient to approximate the CWG as a smooth cylinder of radius $a$ and elementary area $d S = 2 \\pi a d z$ , leading to the energy dissipation density on the cylinder wall:  \n $$\n\\frac { d Q _ { \\mathrm { d i s s } } ( z  \\infty ) } { d S } = \\frac { E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } ^ { 2 } } { 8 \\pi a \\kappa } .\n$$ \n Since the undulating wall of the CWG has a larger surface area per unit length than the smooth cylinder, Equation (16) is an upper bound on the average energy dissipation density in the CWG wall. From Eq. (16), we define the upper bound of the average thermal power dissipation density as  \n $$\nW = \\frac { E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } ^ { 2 } f _ { r } } { 8 \\pi a \\kappa } .\n$$ \n Referring to the plot for $\\kappa$ in Fig. 7, the power dissipation density is reduced by minimizing the corrugation period $p$ and maximizing the spacing parameter $\\xi$ . For structures with $p / a \\lesssim 0 . 5$ , the power dissipation density decreases with an increasing aperture ratio. This results in a trade-off between minimizing the peak surface fields and minimizing the thermal loading of the CWG, where choosing a larger aperture ratio (higher $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ frequency) results in higher peak fields but less thermal power dissipation.  \n Using $\\kappa _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ from Eq. (10) in Eq. (16), we obtain the lower bound of the energy dissipation density as  \n $$\n\\frac { d Q _ { \\mathrm { d i s s } } ( z  \\infty ) } { d S } \\geq \\frac { E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } ^ { 2 } a } { 4 Z _ { 0 } c } .\n$$ \n Here we notice the linear scaling of the energy dissipation with the minor radius, $a$ , which helps smaller diameter structures achieve less heating per pulse and thus higher bunch repetition rates. At a gradient of $E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } = 9 0 ~ \\mathrm { M V } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ , a minor radius of $a = 1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ , and a repetition rate of $f _ { r } = 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { k H z }$ , the minimum theoretical thermal power dissipation density on the wall of the corrugated waveguide is roughly $3 6 ~ \\mathrm { W / c m ^ { 2 } }$ . This is well within the cooling capability of single phase cooling systems using water as a working fluid, see for example [27].  \n In addition to the steady-state thermal load, the transient heating of the corrugation plays an important role in limiting the attainable accelerating gradient. The transient temperature rise due to pulse heating causes degradation of the surface which eventually leads to nucleation sites where electric breakdown may occur [20]. Acceptable transient temperature rise is cited in the literature as $4 0 \\mathrm { K }$ [20], above which the structure begins to incur damage. The transient $\\Delta T$ at the surface is calculated from a Green’s function solution of the thermal diffusion equation in one dimension with Neumann boundary conditions as [20]:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle \\Delta T ( t ) = \\frac { 2 } { \\rho c _ { \\epsilon } } \\int _ { 0 } ^ { t } \\frac { d P _ { d } } { d A } \\frac { 1 } { \\delta } \\mathrm { e x p } \\left[ \\frac { 4 \\alpha _ { d } \\left( t - t ^ { \\prime } \\right) } { \\delta ^ { 2 } } \\right] } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\times \\mathrm { e r f c } \\left[ \\frac { 2 } { \\delta } \\sqrt { \\alpha _ { d } ( t - t ^ { \\prime } ) } \\right] d t ^ { \\prime } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $\\rho$ is the material density, $c _ { \\epsilon }$ is the specific heat, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, $\\alpha _ { d } = k / \\rho c _ { \\epsilon }$ is the thermal diffusivity, and $\\delta = 1 / { \\sqrt { \\pi f \\mu \\sigma } }$ is the skin depth. Here, $d P _ { d } / d A$ , given in Eq. (A9), is the power dissipation density at the waveguide surface due to the induced currents which fall off exponentially in the wall with the skin depth $\\delta$ . This equation is typically approximated by assuming that the skin depth goes to zero such that all the thermal energy is deposited on the surface of the material which simplifies the integral to  \n $$\n\\Delta T ( t ) = \\frac { 1 } { \\rho c _ { \\epsilon } \\sqrt { \\pi \\alpha _ { d } } } \\int _ { 0 } ^ { t } \\frac { d P _ { d } } { d A } \\frac { d t ^ { \\prime } } { \\sqrt { t - t ^ { \\prime } } } .\n$$ \n The error in this approximation is accumulated near the beginning of the pulse when $t$ is close to zero, causing poor accuracy when the peak temperature rise is attained quickly relative to the decay time constant of the pulse. However, the assumption that the energy is confined to the surface rather than being distributed throughout the volume guarantees that the approximation will always be an overestimate. This allows us to calculate an upper bound on $\\Delta T$ by analytically evaluating the integral and maximizing the result as  \n $$\n\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } = 0 . 5 4 1 \\frac { R _ { s } H _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ^ { 2 } \\sqrt { \\tau } } { \\rho c _ { \\epsilon } \\sqrt { \\pi \\alpha _ { d } } } ,\n$$ \n where $\\tau = ( 1 - \\beta _ { g } ) / 2 \\alpha v _ { g }$ is the decay time constant of the rf pulse and $R _ { s } = \\sqrt { \\pi f \\mu / \\sigma }$ is the surface resistance. This result is valid when $\\alpha L > 0 . 4 2 7$ such that the maximum $\\Delta T$ occurs before the end of the pulse. For pure copper at room temperature, the maximum temperature rise in $\\mathrm { \\bf K }$ becomes  \n $$\n\\Delta T _ { \\mathrm { m a x } , c u } = 2 4 2 \\frac { H _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ^ { 2 } } { \\sigma ^ { 1 / 4 } } \\sqrt { \\frac { f ( 1 - \\beta _ { g } ) } { \\alpha _ { 0 } \\beta _ { g } } }\n$$ \n where $H _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ is the peak surface field in $\\mathrm { \\mathbf { M A m } ^ { - 1 } }$ , $f$ is the frequency in $\\mathrm { G H z }$ , and $\\alpha _ { 0 }$ is the attenuation constant in $\\mathrm { { N p } \\mathrm { { m } ^ { - 1 } } }$ for a pure copper structure with $\\sigma { = } 5 . 8 { \\times } 1 0 ^ { 7 } \\mathrm { S m ^ { - 1 } }$ . Here, $\\sigma$ is the effective electrical conductivity of the structure in $S \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ which may be reduced from its nominal value due to surface roughness. The pulse heating depends primarily on the peak magnetic field and group velocity, having only a weak dependence on the electrical conductivity of the material. Higher group velocities lead to less pulse heating due to the shortening of the effective pulse length. Figure 12 shows how the pulse heating varies with the geometry of the maximum radii corrugation. The temperature rise, $\\Delta T$ , increases with increasing corrugation period $p / a$ and decreases with increasing spacing parameter $\\xi . \\ \\Delta T$ also increases with increasing aperture ratio. The optimal corrugation design for minimal pulse heating has a small period, large spacing parameter, and small aperture ratio.  \n  \n VII. HOM CONSIDERATIONS  \n In addition to the fundamental $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode, the wakefield contains contributions from higher order modes (HOMs). Since the HOMs span a range of wavelengths, they may interfere either constructively or destructively with the accelerating mode at the position of the witness bunch leading to a potential reduction in the accelerating gradient. It is desirable to minimize coupling to HOMs to maintain maximum acceleration [12]. Figure 13 shows the wakefield impedance simulated with CST’s wakefield solver for structures with $p / a = 0 . 4$ (left panel) and $p / a = 0 . 7$ (right panel), where the HOMs are seen as additional peaks in the impedance spectrum.  \n Characterization of the HOMs for the maximum radii structures was carried out in CST’s wakefield solver by simulating $2 0 \\mathrm { - m m }$ long corrugated waveguides with minor radius $a = 1$ and an on-axis Gaussian bunch with standard deviation length of $\\sigma _ { s } = 0 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . This bunch length resolves the wake impedance up to $5 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { G H z }$ , capturing a large portion of the HOM spectrum which falls off with frequency. The sum of the loss factors for all modes is calculated as  \n $$\n\\kappa _ { \\mathrm { t o t } } = \\sum \\kappa _ { n } = \\frac { 2 } { L } \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } { \\mathrm { R e } } \\{ Z _ { | | } ( f ) \\} d f ,\n$$ \n where $Z _ { | | }$ is the longitudinal wakefield impedance and $L$ is the length of the structure. The HOM content can be characterized by the sum of HOM loss factors over the sum of all loss factors:  \n $$\n\\mathrm { H O M \\ r a t i o } = \\frac { \\kappa _ { \\mathrm { t o t } } - \\kappa } { \\kappa _ { \\mathrm { t o t } } } ,\n$$ \n where $\\kappa$ is the loss factor of the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode. In this characterization, the HOM ratio goes to 0 as the HOMs vanish, at which point the loss is due exclusively to the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode. Figure 14 shows that the HOM content primarily depends on the corrugation period, where periods larger than $0 . 4 a$ lead to significant HOM coupling. The HOMs also increase modestly with aperture ratio and corrugation spacing. The HOM ratio shown here assumes that all modes are excited equally which is not the case for a finite length bunch with a limited charge spectrum. The actual HOM energy content must account for the bunch shape by inclusion of the form factor discussed in Appendix B.  \n  \n VIII. CORRUGATED WAVEGUIDE DESIGN FOR A-STAR  \n Guided by the preceding analysis of peak fields, thermal loading, and HOM coupling, we now present the CWG design for the A-STAR accelerator under development at Argonne National Laboratory. The dimensions of the structure, shown in Fig. 15, are selected to maximize $E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } }$ and $f _ { r }$ by maintaining manageable thermal loading, peak surface fields, and manufacturability. Experimental measurement of the breakdown rate is required to determine the maximum accelerating gradient.  \n The first step in the design process is to choose the minor radius, $a$ , of the CWG which determines the maximum value of the loss factor $\\kappa$ according to  \n Eq. (10). In choosing $a$ , the beam breakup instability (BBU) caused by the transverse momentum kick on the particles in the tail of the bunch when the leading particles traverse the CWG off-axis has to be considered (see [28] and references therein). Because the kick factor associated with the BBU scales as $a ^ { - 4 }$ [18], the minimum radius of the structure and corresponding maximum loss factor $\\kappa$ are ultimately determined by beam stability constraints. Simulations show that reducing $a$ below $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ may result in the onset of BBU under certain conditions.  \n After determining the minor radius, $a$ , of $1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ , the frequency and corresponding aperture ratio of the synchronous $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ accelerating mode must be chosen. We have shown in Figs. 10 and 12 that the peak surface fields and associated pulse heating increase with aperture ratio while the total power dissipation decreases, as shown by its dependence on the loss factor $\\kappa$ in Eq. (16) and Fig. 7. In addition to these considerations, the frequency must be compatible with the electromagnetic output couplers used to extract rf energy from the structure. An important feature of A-STAR is its ability to measure the trajectory of the bunch in the CWA using the $\\mathrm { H E M } _ { 1 1 }$ mode which is excited when the beam propagates off-axis. Due to mode conversion, the design of the coupler that extracts the $\\mathrm { H E M } _ { 1 1 }$ mode becomes increasingly challenging as the $\\mathrm { H E M } _ { 1 1 }$ wavelength shrinks with respect to the fixed aperture of the waveguide. For the $1 \\mathrm { - m m }$ minor radius cylindrical waveguide, the limiting factor in the $\\mathbf { H E M } _ { 1 1 }$ coupler design was converted to the $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 3 1 }$ mode which has a cutoff frequency of $2 0 0 \\ : \\mathrm { G H z }$ . To address this, the synchronous $\\mathbf { H E M } _ { 1 1 }$ mode was chosen to be $1 0 \\mathrm { G H z }$ below the $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 3 1 }$ cutoff frequency, resulting in a 190-GHz $\\mathrm { H E M } _ { 1 1 }$ mode and 180-GHz $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ mode with an aperture ratio of $a / \\lambda = 0 . 6 0$ .  \n With the minor radius and frequency selected, the corrugation profile is chosen to maximize the accelerating gradient as well as provide a high repetition rate. The $1 \\mathrm { - m m }$ minor radius of the CWG results in corrugation dimensions in the hundreds of $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ which presents unique manufacturing challenges. Several fabrication methods have been investigated for constructing the CWG, with electroforming copper on an aluminum mandrel producing the most promising results [14]. Electroforming at these scales requires that neither the corrugation tooth width nor the vacuum gap is made excessively small since this would result in either a flimsy mandrel or a flimsy final structure. A sensible choice is to make the tooth width similar to the vacuum gap, resulting in $\\xi \\approx 0$ , while using the shortest practical corrugation period. The maximum radii and unequal radii geometries have similar characteristics when $\\xi \\approx 0$ and we have selected the maximum radii design for A-STAR. The final corrugation dimensions are shown in Table II and the electromagnetic characteristics of the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ and $\\mathbf { H E M } _ { 1 1 }$ modes are given in Table III.  \n Maintaining the fundamental $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ and $\\mathrm { H E } _ { 1 1 }$ frequencies within a $\\pm 5$ GHz-bandwidth specified by the design of the output couplers requires dimensional tolerances of roughly $\\pm 1 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } } ,$ as shown by Fig. 5. The most sensitive dimension to manufacturing error is the corrugation depth, which must be carefully controlled to produce the desired frequency. Mode conversion due to the straightness of the CWG is not expected to change the acceleration properties over the short length scale between the drive and witness bunch. However, such effects may become relevant in the operation of the output couplers and are a subject of future analysis.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE II. A-STAR key operating parameters.

For structures longer than ${ \\sim } 1 / \\alpha$ , the pulse length becomes saturated and is determined by the conductivity of the wall material rather than the length of the CWG, where lower conductivity produces a shorter pulse. Because the witness bunch follows close behind the drive bunch, the loss in accelerating gradient for a lossy wall CWG can be small while the overall thermal load remains unchanged according to Eq. (16). This feature of the CWA can potentially be exploited to allow fabrication from lossy materials or use of surface coatings to improve performance. The reduction in pulse length may be used as a way to increase the rf breakdown threshold of the structure.  \n  \n IX. CONCLUSION  \n Through simulation, we have shown how the electromagnetic parameters characterizing the $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 0 1 }$ synchronous mode of a cylindrical CWG used as a slow-wave structure depend on the corrugation period, spacing, sidewall angle, and frequency of the accelerating mode. In analyzing the structures, we found that minimizing the corrugation period plays a key role in reducing the peak electromagnetic fields, thermal loading, and coupling to HOMs. Taking into account electromagnetic and manufacturing considerations, we found the most practical corrugation profile has vertical sidewalls and a corrugation tooth width similar to the width of the vacuum gap. Using the results of our analysis, we have designed a prototype CWG for the A-STAR CWA under development at Argonne National Laboratory. The calculated parameters of A-STAR suggest that a CWA based on a metallic corrugated waveguide is a promising approach to realize a new generation of high repetition rates and compact XFEL light sources.  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n This manuscript is based upon work supported by Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), provided by the Director, Office of Science, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DEAC02-06CH11357.

We will assume that $\\sigma$ satisfies the conditions of a good conductor so that the field solutions are independent of conductivity.  \n The time harmonic eigenmode solutions $E$ and $\\pmb { H }$ produced by CST are normalized such that the stored energy $U$ in the unit cell is 1 J and the frequency is $\\omega$ . Uniformly scaling the geometry by a constant $\\hat { \\boldsymbol a }$ while holding the stored energy fixed results in the scaled eigenmode solutions:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { E ^ { \\prime } ( x , y , z ) e ^ { j \\omega ^ { \\prime } t } = \\hat { a } ^ { - 3 / 2 } E ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } , z ^ { \\prime } ) e ^ { j \\omega _ { \\hat { a } } ^ { t } } } \\\\ & { H ^ { \\prime } ( x , y , z ) e ^ { j \\omega ^ { \\prime } t } = \\hat { a } ^ { - 3 / 2 } H ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } , z ^ { \\prime } ) e ^ { j \\omega _ { \\hat { a } } ^ { t } } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where  \n $$\nx ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { x } { \\hat { a } } , \\qquad y ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { y } { \\hat { a } } , \\qquad z ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { z } { \\hat { a } } , \\qquad \\omega ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { \\omega } { \\hat { a } } .\n$$ \n Scaling the fields by $\\hat { a } ^ { - 3 / 2 }$ keeps the stored energy $U ^ { \\prime }$ of the scaled structure same as that of the unscaled structure $U$ , which is seen by integrating the total energy in the fields:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { \\displaystyle U ^ { \\prime } = \\iiint \\frac { \\epsilon _ { 0 } } { 2 } | \\hat { a } ^ { - 3 / 2 } E ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } , z ^ { \\prime } ) | ^ { 2 } } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle \\quad + \\frac { \\mu _ { 0 } } { 2 } | \\hat { a } ^ { - 3 / 2 } H ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } , z ^ { \\prime } ) | ^ { 2 } d x d y d z } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle = \\iiint \\frac { \\epsilon _ { 0 } } { 2 } | E ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } , z ^ { \\prime } ) | ^ { 2 } } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle \\quad + \\frac { \\mu _ { 0 } } { 2 } | H ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } , z ^ { \\prime } ) | ^ { 2 } d x ^ { \\prime } d y ^ { \\prime } d z ^ { \\prime } = U , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where the integrals are over all space. Applying the normalized fields with $U = 1$ to Eq. (8) for the group velocity shows that group velocity is independent of scaling  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { { v _ { g } ^ { \\prime } = \\hat { a } p \\iint \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\mathrm { R e } \\big \\{ E ^ { \\prime } ( x , y ) \\times H ^ { \\prime * } ( x , y ) \\big \\} d x d y } } \\\\ { { \\mathrm { ~ } = p \\iint \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\mathrm { R e } \\big \\{ E ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } ) \\times H ^ { * } ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } ) \\big \\} d x ^ { \\prime } d y ^ { \\prime } = v _ { g } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Using Eq. (7), the induced voltage $V ^ { \\prime }$ in the scaled structure is  \n $$\nV ^ { \\prime } = \\biggr | \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\hat { a } p } \\hat { a } ^ { - 3 / 2 } E _ { z } ( z ^ { \\prime } ) e ^ { j \\omega _ { c } ^ { \\prime } } d z \\biggr | ,\n$$ \n which can be written as  \n $$\nV ^ { \\prime } = \\biggr \\vert \\int _ { 0 } ^ { p } \\hat { a } ^ { - 1 / 2 } E _ { z } ( z ^ { \\prime } ) e ^ { j \\omega _ { c } ^ { z ^ { \\prime } } } d z ^ { \\prime } \\biggr \\vert = \\frac { V } { \\hat { a } ^ { 1 / 2 } } .\n$$ \n Since we have normalized the fields with $U = 1 \\mathrm { ~ J ~ }$ and shown that the group velocity $\\beta _ { g }$ is independent of scaling, Equation (6) is used to write the loss factor for the scaled structure as  \n $$\n\\kappa ^ { \\prime } = \\frac { V ^ { \\prime 2 } / U } { 4 ( 1 - \\beta _ { g } ) \\hat { a } p } = \\frac { \\kappa } { \\hat { a } ^ { 2 } } .\n$$ \n The quality factor $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ of the corrugation unit cell is defined as  \n $$\nQ = \\frac { \\omega U } { P _ { d } } ,\n$$ \n where $U$ is stored energy and $P _ { d }$ is the power dissipated in the cavity walls. The power dissipation density per unit area is  \n $$\n\\frac { d P _ { d } } { d A } = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\sqrt { \\frac { \\omega \\mu } { 2 \\sigma } } | { \\cal H } | ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n In the scaled structure, the power dissipation and resulting quality factor become  \n $$\nP _ { d } ^ { \\prime } = \\hat { a } ^ { - 3 / 2 } P _ { d } , \\qquad Q ^ { \\prime } = \\hat { a } ^ { 1 / 2 } Q ,\n$$ \n leading to the scaled attenuation constant from Eq. (9)  \n $$\n\\alpha ^ { \\prime } = \\hat { a } ^ { - 3 / 2 } \\alpha .\n$$ \n Scaling of the attenuation constant $\\alpha$ with conductivity is accomplished by multiplying $\\alpha$ by $\\sqrt { \\sigma / \\sigma ^ { \\prime } }$ where $\\sigma$ is the conductivity of the unscaled structure and $\\sigma ^ { \\prime }$ is the conductivity of the scaled structure.  \n APPENDIX B: BUNCH FORM FACTOR DERIVATION  \n When calculating a bunch’s energy loss to a particular mode of the corrugated waveguide, the shape of the bunch described by the bunch peak current distribution $i ( t )$ is accounted for by scaling the loss factor $\\kappa$ by the Fourier transform ${ \\cal I } ( \\omega _ { n } )$ of the current, where $\\omega _ { n }$ is the angular frequency of the synchronous mode. The form factor $F ( k _ { n } )$ of the bunch is defined as ${ \\cal I } ( \\omega _ { n } ) / q _ { 0 }$ , where $k _ { n }$ is the wave number of the synchronous mode and $q _ { 0 }$ is the total charge of the bunch. Here, time $t$ begins when the head of the bunch passes a fixed observation point in the corrugated waveguide. We begin by considering the kinetic energy lost by an element of charge idt as it moves a distance cdt in an electric field $E _ { z }$ :  \n $$\nd ^ { 2 } U _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } } = ( i d t ) ( c d t ) E _ { z } .\n$$ \n Here, the electric field $E _ { z }$ is the wakefield left behind by the current in the head of the bunch which has already passed the observation point. The wakefield produced by a current impulse $q _ { 0 } \\delta ( t )$ is the Green’s function $h ( t )$ which is expressed as an expansion over the normal modes of the corrugation unit cell as  \n $$\nh ( t ) = \\sum _ { n = 0 } ^ { \\infty } 2 \\kappa _ { n } \\cos { ( \\omega _ { n } t ) } \\theta ( t ) ,\n$$ \n where $\\theta ( t )$ is the Heaviside theta function  \n $$\n\\theta ( t ) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array} { l l } { 0 } & { t < 0 } \\\\ { 1 / 2 } & { t = 0 } \\\\ { 1 } & { t > 0 } \\end{array} \\right.\n$$ \n and $\\kappa _ { n }$ is the loss factor given in Eq. (6) in units of $\\mathrm { { V } m ^ { - 1 } C ^ { - 1 } }$ . The fields in the unit cell are time harmonic, oscillating with frequency $\\omega _ { n }$ . Because the structure is approximated to be periodic, the oscillating fields are part of an infinitely long traveling wave that never decays. In terms of the Green’s function $h ( t )$ , the wakefield $E _ { z } ( t )$ due to the total current distribution $i ( t )$ is then constructed with the convolution integral  \n $$\nE _ { z } ( t ) = \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } h ( t - t ^ { \\prime } ) i ( t ^ { \\prime } ) d t ^ { \\prime } .\n$$ \n Inserting Eq. (B4) into Eq. (B1) and integrating over the time axis of the bunch produce the power being deposited into the wakefield  \n $$\nP _ { w } = \\frac { d U _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } } } { d t } = c \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } i ( t ) \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } h ( t - t ^ { \\prime } ) i ( t ^ { \\prime } ) d t ^ { \\prime } d t .\n$$ \n Defining the Fourier transform and its inverse  \n $$\nI ( \\omega ) = \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } i ( t ) e ^ { - j \\omega t } d t ,\n$$ \n $$\ni ( t ) = { \\frac { 1 } { 2 \\pi } } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } I ( \\omega ) e ^ { j \\omega t } d \\omega .\n$$ \n Equation (B5) can now be written in terms of the Fourier transformed functions as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { P _ { w } = \\displaystyle \\frac { c } { ( 2 \\pi ) ^ { 3 } } \\mathrm { R e } \\Bigg \\{ \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } I ( \\omega _ { 2 } ) e ^ { j \\omega _ { 2 } t } d \\omega _ { 2 } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } } } \\\\ { { \\times \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } I ( \\omega _ { 1 } ) e ^ { j \\omega _ { 1 } ( t - t ^ { \\prime } ) } d \\omega _ { 1 } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } Z _ { | | } ( \\omega ) e ^ { j \\omega t ^ { \\prime } } d \\omega d t ^ { \\prime } d t \\Bigg \\} . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Here we have used the convolution’s commutative property to switch the roles of $i$ and $h$ in the convolution integral and written the Fourier transform of Green’s function $h ( t )$ as the longitudinal wake impedance $Z _ { | | } ( \\omega )$ . The subscripts added to the $\\omega$ variables indicate that they are independent, allowing Eq. (B8) to be rearranged:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c c c } { { P _ { w } = \\displaystyle \\frac { c } { ( 2 \\pi ) ^ { 3 } } \\mathrm { R e } \\left\\{ \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } d \\omega \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } d \\omega _ { 2 } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } d \\omega _ { 1 } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } d t \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } d t ^ { \\prime } \\right. } }  \\\\ { { \\left. \\times I ( \\omega _ { 2 } ) I ( \\omega _ { 1 } ) Z _ { | | } ( \\omega ) e ^ { j t ( \\omega _ { 1 } + \\omega _ { 2 } ) } e ^ { j t ^ { \\prime } ( \\omega - \\omega _ { 1 } ) } \\right\\} . } } & { { ( \\mathrm { B 9 } ) } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The integrals in $t$ and $t ^ { \\prime }$ produce Dirac delta functions leaving  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l } { \\displaystyle P _ { w } = \\frac { c } { 2 \\pi } \\mathrm { R e } \\Bigg \\{ \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } d \\omega \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } d \\omega _ { 2 } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } d \\omega _ { 1 } } \\\\ { \\displaystyle \\times I ( \\omega _ { 2 } ) I ( \\omega _ { 1 } ) Z _ { | | } ( \\omega ) \\delta ( \\omega _ { 1 } + \\omega _ { 2 } ) \\delta ( \\omega - \\omega _ { 1 } ) \\Bigg \\} . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Using the sifting property of the delta function to evaluate the integral Eq. (B10) becomes  \n $$\nP _ { \\ w } = \\frac { c } { 2 \\pi } \\mathrm { R e } \\Bigg \\{ \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } I ( - \\omega ) I ( \\omega ) Z _ { | | } ( \\omega ) d \\omega \\Bigg \\} .\n$$ \n Since the current density $i ( t )$ is a purely real function, $I ( - \\omega ) = I ^ { * } ( \\omega )$ where $*$ denotes complex conjugation, leading to  \n $$\nP _ { \\nu } = \\frac { c } { 2 \\pi } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } | I ( \\omega ) | ^ { 2 } \\operatorname { R e } \\{ Z _ { | | } ( \\omega ) \\} d \\omega .\n$$ \n Equation (B12) represents the power being converted from kinetic energy to electromagnetic energy in the frequency domain. Considering a single mode denoted by the subscript $n$ , the wake impedance is  \n $$\nZ _ { n | | } ( \\omega ) = \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } 2 \\kappa _ { n } \\cos ( \\omega _ { n } t ) \\theta ( t ) e ^ { - j \\omega t } d t .\n$$ \n Using the Fourier transform property  \n $$\n\\mathcal { F } \\{ f ( t ) \\cos ( a t ) \\} = \\frac { F ( \\omega - a ) + F ( \\omega + a ) } { 2 } ,\n$$ \n and the Fourier transform of the step function  \n $$\n\\mathcal { F } \\{ \\theta ( t ) \\} = \\pi \\biggl ( \\frac { 1 } { j \\pi \\omega } + \\delta ( \\omega ) \\biggr ) ,\n$$ \n the wake impedance becomes  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { Z _ { n | | } ( \\omega ) = \\kappa _ { n } \\Bigg [ \\pi [ \\delta ( \\omega - \\omega _ { n } ) + \\delta ( \\omega + \\omega _ { n } ) ] } \\\\ { - j \\Bigg ( \\cfrac { 1 } { ( \\omega - \\omega _ { n } ) } + \\frac { 1 } { ( \\omega + \\omega _ { n } ) } \\Bigg ) \\Bigg ] . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Using $Z _ { n | | } ( \\omega )$ in Eq. (B12) and evaluating the integral yields  \n $$\nP _ { w , n } = \\frac { \\kappa _ { n } c } { 2 } ( | I ( \\omega _ { n } ) | ^ { 2 } + | I ( - \\omega _ { n } ) | ^ { 2 } ) .\n$$ \n Again, using the fact that the current distribution is a purely real function, we obtain  \n $$\nP _ { \\boldsymbol { w } , n } = \\kappa _ { n } c | I ( \\omega _ { n } ) | ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n Assuming the loss factor $\\kappa _ { n }$ is uniform throughout the corrugated waveguide of length $L$ , the total energy lost by the bunch to the wakefield mode is  \n $$\nU _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } , n } = \\kappa _ { n } L | I ( \\omega _ { n } ) | ^ { 2 }\n$$ \n In terms of the bunch form factor, $F ( k )$ is defined as  \n $$\nF ( k ) = { \\frac { 1 } { q _ { 0 } } } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } q ( s ) e ^ { - j k s } d s ,\n$$ \n where $s$ is the longitudinal displacement from the head of the bunch and $k$ is the wave number, the energy loss is  \n $$\nU _ { \\mathrm { l o s s } , n } = \\kappa _ { n } q _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } | { \\cal F } ( k _ { n } ) | ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n We will now consider the effect of the bunch charge density $q ( s )$ on the accelerating field $E _ { z } ( s )$ in order to understand how $E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } }$ and the peak surface fields depend on $q ( s )$ . To begin, we write $E _ { z , n }$ due to a single mode as a convolution  \n $$\nE _ { z , n } ( s ) = \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } q ( s - s ^ { \\prime } ) 2 \\kappa _ { n } \\cos ( k _ { n } s ^ { \\prime } ) \\theta ( s ^ { \\prime } ) d s ^ { \\prime } .\n$$ \n Since $q ( s )$ is a real function,  \n $$\nE _ { z , n } ( s ) = 2 \\kappa _ { n } \\mathrm { R e } \\Bigg \\{ \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } q ( s - s ^ { \\prime } ) e ^ { j k _ { n } s ^ { \\prime } } d s ^ { \\prime } \\Bigg \\} .\n$$ \n Making the substitution $u = s - s ^ { \\prime }$ ,  \n $$\nE _ { z , n } ( s ) = 2 \\kappa _ { n } \\operatorname { R e } \\Biggl \\{ \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { s } q ( u ) e ^ { j k _ { n } ( s - u ) } d u \\Biggr \\} .\n$$ \n Since we are only interested in the fields behind the bunch, we take the limit as $s  \\infty$ , noting that the result will be valid outside the bunch where $q ( s ) = 0$ :  \n $$\nE _ { z , n } ( s \\to \\infty ) = 2 \\kappa _ { n } \\operatorname { R e } \\left\\{ e ^ { j k _ { n } s } \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } q ( u ) e ^ { - j k _ { n } u } d u \\right\\} .\n$$ \n We can now write the field in terms of the previously derived form factor $F ( k _ { n } )$ given in Eq. (B20):  \n $$\nE _ { z , n } ( s \\to \\infty ) = 2 \\kappa _ { n } q _ { 0 } \\mathrm { R e } \\{ e ^ { j k _ { n } s } F ( k _ { n } ) \\}\n$$ \n Expanding the real part  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { E _ { z , n } ( s  \\infty ) = 2 \\kappa _ { n } q _ { 0 } [ \\cos ( k _ { n } s ) \\mathrm { R e } \\{ F ( k _ { n } ) \\} } \\\\ { - \\sin ( k _ { n } s ) \\mathrm { I m } \\{ F ( k _ { n } ) \\} ] . \\qquad } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Since we are interested in the maximum value of the longitudinal accelerating field, we define $E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } }$ as the amplitude of $E _ { z , n } \\big ( s  \\infty \\big )$ :  \n $$\nE _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } = 2 \\kappa q _ { 0 } \\sqrt { \\mathrm { R e } \\{ F ( k _ { n } ) \\} ^ { 2 } + \\mathrm { I m } \\{ F ( k _ { n } ) \\} ^ { 2 } }\n$$ \n which reduces to  \n $$\nE _ { \\mathrm { a c c } } = 2 \\kappa q _ { 0 } | F ( k _ { n } ) |\n$$ \n For the doorstep distribution of Eq. (25) with transformer ratio $\\mathcal { R }$ and wave number $k _ { n } = \\omega _ { n } / c$ , the form factor $| F ( k ) |$ is calculated from Eq. (B20) as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l r }   { | F ( k ) | = \\frac { 2 k _ { n } } { \\mathcal { R } ^ { 2 } + \\pi - 2 } \\{ \\frac { \\mathcal { R } ^ { 2 } } { k ^ { 2 } } + \\frac { 2 k _ { n } } { k ^ { 3 } } [ \\frac { k _ { n } } { k } [ 1 - \\cos ( k l - \\frac { \\pi k } { 2 k _ { n } } ) ]  } \\\\ & { } & {  + \\sin ( k l ) - \\sin ( \\frac { \\pi k } { 2 k _ { n } } ) ] } \\\\ & { } & {  - \\frac { 2 } { k ^ { 2 } } \\sqrt { \\mathcal { R } ^ { 2 } - 1 } [ \\cos ( k l )  + \\frac { k _ { n } } { k } \\sin ( k l - \\frac { \\pi k } { 2 k _ { n } } ) ] \\} ^ { 1 / 2 } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where the bunch length $l$ is  \n $$\nl = \\frac { \\frac { \\pi } { 2 } + \\sqrt { \\mathcal { R } ^ { 2 } - 1 } - 1 } { k _ { n } } .\n$$ \n Evaluating the form factor at $k = k _ { n }$ produces  \n $$\n| F ( k _ { n } ) | = \\frac { 2 \\mathcal { R } } { \\mathcal { R } ^ { 2 } + \\pi - 2 } .\n$$ \n This result leads to the accelerating gradient $E _ { \\mathrm { a c c } }$ scaling with the inverse of the transformer ratio $\\mathcal { R }$ .  \n [1] A.

        "text_data": "Chapter I.10  \n Synchrotron radiation  \n Rasmus Ischebeck Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland  \n Electrons circulating in a storage ring emit synchrotron radiation. The spectrum of this powerful radiation spans from the far infrared to the $\\boldsymbol { \\mathrm { \\Sigma } } _ { \\mathrm { X } }$ -rays. Synchrotron radiation has evolved from being a mere byproduct of particle acceleration to a powerful tool leveraged in diverse scientific and engineering fields. Indeed, synchrotrons are the most brilliant X-ray sources on Earth, and they find use in a wide range of fields in research. In this chapter, we will look at the generation of radiation of charged particles in an accelerator, at the influence of this on the beam dynamics, and on the physics behind applications of synchrotron radiation for research.  \n I.10.1 Introduction  \n It is difficult to overstate the importance of X-rays for medicine, research and industry. Already a few years after their discovery by Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, their ability to penetrate matter established Xrays as an important diagnostics tool in medicine. Experiments with $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -rays have come a long way since the inception of the first $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray tubes. The short wavelength of $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -rays allowed Rosalynd Franklin and Raymond Gosling to take diffraction images that would lead to the discovery of the structure of DNA. Today, X-ray diffraction is an indispensable tool in structural biology and in pharmaceutical research. Industrial applications of X-rays range from cargo inspection to sterilization and crack detection.  \n In addition to bremsstrahlung from $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray tubes, scientists use synchrotron radiation generated by relativistic electrons in vacuum, as those are accelerated by magnetic fields. Initially perceived as a nuisance in the context of high-energy physics accelerators, synchrotron radiation emerged as a critical factor limiting the energy gain in circular electron accelerators. However, its unique characteristics— such as high brightness, broad spectrum covering from infrared to X-rays, and excellent collimation— have transformed it into an invaluable asset in areas ranging from material science to biology. In this chapter, we will encounter accelerators such as the Swiss Light Source (see Fig. I.10.1), that are built solely to generate X-rays.  \n Synchrotrons, as well as free electron lasers, supply users with $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray beams of unsurpassed brillance, and they attract scientists from various research fields. This brillance is the figure of merit for many experiments using X-rays, and is defined as  \n $$\nB = \\frac { \\dot { N } _ { \\gamma } } { 4 \\pi ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { x } \\sigma _ { y } \\sigma _ { x ^ { \\prime } } \\sigma _ { y ^ { \\prime } } ( 0 . 1 \\% \\mathrm { B W } ) } .\n$$ \n Figure I.10.2 shows the development of the peak brilliance of $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray sources during the last century. Scientists working in synchrotron radiation facilities have gotten accustomed to an extremely high flux, as well as an excellent stability of their X-ray source. The flux is controlled on the permille level, and the position stability is measured in micrometers.  \n Synchrotron radiation was first observed on April 24, 1947 by Herb Pollock, Robert Langmuir, Frank Elder, and Anatole Gurewitsch, when they saw a gleam of bluish-white light emerging from the transparent vacuum tube of their new $7 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ electron synchrotron at General Electric’s Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York1. It was first considered a nuisance because it caused the particles to lose energy, but it was recognised in the 1960s as radiation with exceptional properties that overcame the shortcomings of X-ray tubes. Furthermore, it was discovered that the emission of radiation improved the emittance of the beams in electron storage rings, and additional series of dipole magnets were installed at the Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA) at Harvard University to provide additional damping of betatron and synchrotron oscillations.  \n The evolution of synchrotron sources has proceeded in four generations, where each new generation made use of unique new features in science and engineering to increase the coherent flux available to experiments:  \n – First generation: 1050s to 1970s. Those were accelerators initially designed for high-energy physics experiments; synchrotron radiation was a byproduct. They were a significant advance with respect to $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray tubes, but by today’s standards, they are characterized by a relatively low brightness and flux. Radiation is generated in bending magnets that are used to keep electrons on a circular path. Examples for this generation include SPEAR at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the U.S., and DORIS at DESY in Germany.  \n – Second generation: Late 1970s to 1990s. These accelerators were designed specifically as vdedr-y icated syn chr otron radiation sou rces.  Brig ht ness and  flux were inc reas ed wit h resp ect to thehfiarsnt generation, by utilizin g wig glers to en hanc e th e int ens ity of the emitte d radiation.

FaEnLds are treated in Chapte r II I.7.  \n The key properties of synchrotron radiation are:  \n – Broad spectrum available,   \n– High flux,   \n– High spectral brightness,   \n– High degree of transverse coherence,   \n– Polarization can be controlled,   \n– Pulsed time structure,   \n– Stability,   \n– Power can be computed from first principles.  \n We will now navigate through the electromagnetic theory to understand how synchrotron radiation is generated when relativistic electrons are subjected to magnetic fields, noting in particular undulators, insertion devices present in every synchrotron radiation source. We will then look at the effect of the emission of synchrotron radiation on the particle bunches in a storage ring, and come to the surprising conclusion that this actually improves the emittance of the beam. We will then explore recent technological advancements in accelerator physics, which allow improving the transverse coherence of the $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray beams significantly. Finally, we will look at the interaction of $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -rays with matter, and give an overview of scientific uses of synchrotron radiation.  \n I.10.2 Generation of radiation by charged particles  \n An accelerated charge emits electromagnetic radiation. An oscillating charge emits radiation at the oscillation frequency, and a charged particle moving on a circular orbit radiates at the revolution frequency. As soon as the particles approach the speed of light, however, this radiation is shifted towards higher frequencies, and it is concentrated in a forward cone, as shown in Fig. I.10.3.  \n I.10.2.1 Non-relativistic particles moving in a dipole field  \n Let us first look at non-relativistic particles. In a constant magnetic field with magnitude $B$ , a particle with charge $e$ and momentum $p = m v$ will move on a circular orbit with radius $\\rho$  \n $$\n\\rho = \\frac { p } { e B } .\n$$ \n This is an accelerated motion, and the particle emits radiation. For non-relativistic particles, this radiation is called cyclotron radiation, and the total emitted power is  \n $$\nP = \\sigma _ { t } \\frac { B ^ { 2 } v ^ { 2 } } { \\mu _ { 0 } c } ,\n$$ \n where $\\sigma _ { t }$ is the Thomson cross section  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { t } = \\frac { 8 \\pi } { 3 } \\left( \\frac { e ^ { 2 } } { 4 \\pi \\varepsilon _ { 0 } m c ^ { 2 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n The radiation is emitted in all directions except in the direction of acceleration (see Fig. I.10.3 A). The frequency of the emitted radiation is exactly the revolution frequency  \n $$\nf = { \\frac { v } { 2 \\pi \\rho } } .\n$$ \n I.10.2.2 Relativistic particles moving in a dipole field  \n For relativistic particles, this radiation is Lorentz-boosted in the forward direction (see Fig. I.10.3 B). The relativistic Doppler shift results in significantly shorter wavelengths, corresponding to higher photon energies. Furthermore, the radiation seen by an observer in the plane of revolution is pulsed, peaking every time that the particle passes by.  \n The properties of this so-called synchrotron radiation can be calculated directly from Maxwell’s equations, without the need for material constants. For a particle that follows a trajectory $\\vec { x } = \\vec { r } ( t )$ , the charge density and the current distribution are given by  \n $$\n\\rho ( \\vec { x } , t ) = e \\delta ^ { ( 3 ) } ( \\vec { x } - \\vec { r } ( t ) ) \\quad \\mathrm { a n d } \\quad \\vec { j } ( \\vec { x } , t ) = e \\vec { v } ( t ) \\delta ^ { ( 3 ) } ( \\vec { x } - \\vec { r } ( t ) ) ,\n$$ \n respectively. The solution to Maxwell’s equations for this time-varying charge and current density can be found by using the wave equation for the electromagnetic potentials. In the Lorentz gauge, this wave equation reads  \n $$\n\\vec { \\nabla } ^ { 2 } \\Phi - \\frac { 1 } { c ^ { 2 } } \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } \\Phi } { \\partial t ^ { 2 } } = - \\frac { e } { \\varepsilon _ { 0 } } \\vec { \\nabla } ^ { 2 } \\vec { A } - \\frac { 1 } { c ^ { 2 } } \\frac { \\partial ^ { 2 } \\vec { A } } { \\partial t ^ { 2 } } = - \\mu _ { 0 } \\vec { j } .\n$$ \n The general solutions for the potentials given by time-varying charge and current densities can be found  \n by integrating over time and space  \n $$\n\\Phi ( \\vec { x } , t ) = \\frac { 1 } { 4 \\pi \\varepsilon _ { 0 } } \\int d ^ { 3 } \\vec { x } ^ { \\prime } \\int d t ^ { \\prime } \\frac { \\rho ( \\vec { x } ^ { \\prime } , t ) } { | \\vec { x } - \\vec { x } ^ { \\prime } | } \\delta \\left( t ^ { \\prime } + \\frac { \\vec { x } - \\vec { x } ^ { \\prime } } { c } - t \\right)\n$$ \n and  \n $$\n\\vec { A } ( \\vec { x } , t ) = \\frac { 1 } { 4 \\pi \\varepsilon _ { 0 } C ^ { 2 } } \\int d ^ { 3 } \\vec { x } ^ { \\prime } \\int d t ^ { \\prime } \\frac { \\vec { j } ( \\vec { x } ^ { \\prime } , t ) } { | \\vec { x } - \\vec { x } ^ { \\prime } | } \\delta \\left( t ^ { \\prime } + \\frac { \\vec { x } - \\vec { x } ^ { \\prime } } { c } - t \\right) .\n$$ \n Solving the wave equation in this most general sense is quite elaborate. The derivation can be found in Jackson [1], Chapter 6. Here, we just cite the result: the intensity of the radiation per solid angle $d \\Omega$ and per frequency interval $d \\omega$ is given by  \n $$\n\\frac { d ^ { 3 } I } { d \\Omega d \\omega } = \\frac { e ^ { 2 } } { 1 6 \\pi ^ { 3 } \\varepsilon _ { 0 } c } \\left( \\frac { 2 \\omega \\rho } { 3 c \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } \\left( 1 + \\gamma ^ { 2 } \\vartheta ^ { 2 } \\right) ^ { 2 } \\left[ K _ { 2 / 3 } ^ { 2 } ( \\xi ) + \\frac { \\gamma ^ { 2 } \\vartheta ^ { 2 } } { 1 + \\gamma ^ { 2 } \\vartheta ^ { 2 } } K _ { 1 / 3 } ^ { 2 } ( \\xi ) \\right] ,\n$$ \n where $K$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind, $\\gamma$ is the relativistic factor of the particle, $\\vartheta$ is the angle between the (local) trajectory of the particle and the observation point, and the normalized frequency $\\xi$ is given by  \n $$\n\\xi = \\frac { \\omega \\rho } { 3 c \\gamma ^ { 3 } } \\left( 1 + \\gamma ^ { 2 } \\vartheta ^ { 2 } \\right) ^ { 3 / 2 } .\n$$ \n Due to the properties of the modified Bessel function, the radiation intensity is negligible for $\\xi \\gg 1$ . We define the critical frequency $\\omega _ { c }$ as  \n $$\n\\omega _ { c } = { \\frac { 3 } { 2 } } { \\frac { c } { \\rho } } \\gamma ^ { 3 } .\n$$ \n The critical frequency is the typical frequency of synchrotron radiation: half of the energy is radiated at frequencies $\\omega > \\omega _ { c }$ , half at frequencies $\\omega < \\omega _ { c }$ . Correspondingly, we define a critical (i.e. a typical) photon energy $E _ { c }$  \n $$\nE _ { c } = \\hbar \\omega _ { c } = \\frac { 3 } { 2 } \\frac { \\hbar c } { \\rho } \\gamma ^ { 3 } .\n$$ \n The critical angle is defined as  \n $$\n\\vartheta _ { c } = \\frac { 1 } { \\gamma } \\left( \\frac { \\omega _ { c } } { \\omega } \\right) ^ { 1 / 3 } .\n$$ \n Higher frequencies have a smaller critical angle. For frequencies much larger than the critical frequency, and for angles much larger than the critical angle, the synchrotron radiation emission is negligible.  \n The total spectrum, integrated over all emission angles, is given by  \n $$\n\\frac { d I } { d \\omega } = \\int \\int _ { 4 \\pi } \\frac { d ^ { 3 } I } { d \\omega d \\Omega } d \\Omega = \\frac { \\sqrt { 3 } e ^ { 2 } } { 4 \\pi \\varepsilon _ { 0 } c } \\gamma \\frac { \\omega } { \\omega _ { c } } \\int _ { \\omega / \\omega _ { c } } ^ { \\infty } K _ { 5 / 3 } ( x ) d x .\n$$ \n It is shown in Fig. I.10.4. Unlike cyclotron radiation, emitted by non-relativistic electrons, synchrotron radiation has a broadband spectrum, shifted towards higher photon energies with the cube of the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ . In the Swiss Light Source, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is approximately 5000. As a result, the critical frequency of the radiation emitted by the dipole magnets is in the exahertz range, corresponding to the $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray spectrum. The overall spectrum of synchrotron radiation covers infrared, visible, UV and X-ray wavelengths. While coherent beams in or near the visible spectrum can be conveniently generated by lasers, synchrotrons are widely used in research that requires X-ray photons. We will look at some typical  \n applications in Section I.10.6.  \n The total radiated power per particle, obtained by integrating over the spectrum, is  \n $$\nP _ { \\gamma } = \\frac { e ^ { 2 } c } { 6 \\pi \\varepsilon _ { 0 } } \\frac { \\beta ^ { 4 } \\gamma ^ { 4 } } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } .\n$$ \n The energy lost by a particle on a circular orbit, i.e. in an accelerator consisting only of dipole magnets, is  \n $$\nU _ { 0 } = \\frac { e ^ { 2 } \\beta ^ { 4 } \\gamma ^ { 4 } } { 3 \\varepsilon _ { 0 } \\rho } ,\n$$ \n where we have used $T = 2 \\pi \\rho / c$ , assuming $v \\approx c$ . Of course, real accelerators contain also other types of magnets. The energy lost per turn for a particle in an arbitrary accelerator lattice can be calculated by the following ring integral  \n $$\nU _ { 0 } = \\frac { C _ { \\gamma } } { 2 \\pi } E _ { \\mathrm { n o m } } ^ { 4 } \\oint \\frac { 1 } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } d s ,\n$$ \n where $E _ { \\mathrm { n o m } }$ is the nominal beam energy and  \n $$\nC _ { \\gamma } = \\frac { e ^ { 2 } } { 3 \\varepsilon _ { 0 } ( m _ { e } c ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 4 } } .\n$$ \n We define the following integral as the second synchrotron radiation integral  \n $$\nI _ { 2 } : = \\oint \\frac { 1 } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } d s .\n$$ \n From the energy lost per turn $U _ { 0 }$ and the critical photon energy $E _ { c }$ , we can calculate an average number of photons to be approximately  \n $$\n\\langle n _ { \\gamma } \\rangle \\approx \\frac { 1 6 \\pi } { 9 } \\alpha _ { \\mathrm { f i n e } } \\gamma ,\n$$ \n where $\\alpha _ { \\mathrm { f i n e } } \\approx 1 / 1 3 7$ is the fine structure constant. This is a relatively small number; we will therefore have to consider the quantum nature of the radiation, and we will see later how this quantum nature ultimately defines the beam emittance in an electron storage ring.  \n The total radiated power depends on the fourth power of the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ , or for a given particle energy, it is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the mass of this particle. This means that synchrotron radiation, and its effect on the beam, are negligible for all proton accelerators except for the highest-energy one. For electron storage rings, conversely, this radiation dominates power losses of the beam, the evolution of the emittance in the ring, and therefore the beam dynamics of the accelerator. Before we will look at this in detail, we will treat one particular case where the electrons pass through a sinusoidal magnetic field. Such a field, generated by wigglers and undulators2, gives rise to strong radiation in the forward direction, which makes it particularly useful for applications of $\\mathrm { \\Delta } \\mathrm { X }$ -rays.  \n I.10.2.3 Coherent generation of X-rays in undulators  \n Wiggler and undulator magnets are devices that impose a periodic magnetic field on the electron beam. These insertion devices have been specially designed to excite the emission of electromagnetic radiation in particle accelerators.  \n Let us assume a cartesian coordinate system with an electron travelling in $z$ direction.  \n A planar insertion device, with a mangetic field in the vertical direction $y$ , has the following field on axis  \n $$\n\\vec { B } ( 0 , 0 , z ) = \\vec { u } _ { y } B _ { 0 } \\sin ( k _ { u } z ) ,\n$$ \n where $k _ { u } = 2 \\pi / \\lambda _ { u }$ with $\\lambda _ { u }$ the period of the magnetic field, $B _ { 0 }$ is the maximum field and $\\vec { u } _ { y }$ is the unit vector in $y$ direction. Due to the Maxwell equations, the curl and divergence of the static magnetic field vanish in vacuum, $\\vec { \\nabla } \\times \\vec { B } = 0$ and $\\vec { \\nabla } \\cdot \\vec { B } = 0$ . Thus, the field acquires a $z$ component for $y \\ne 0$  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { { { \\cal B } _ { x } } } & { { = } } & { { 0 } } \\\\ { { { \\cal B } _ { y } } } & { { = } } & { { { \\cal B } _ { 0 } \\cosh ( k _ { u } y ) \\sin ( k _ { u } z ) } } \\\\ { { { \\cal B } _ { z } } } & { { = } } & { { { \\cal B } _ { 0 } \\sinh ( k _ { u } y ) \\cos ( k _ { u } z ) . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The difference to Equation I.10.13 is small for $k _ { u } y \\ll 1$ and will be neglected in the following.  \n Helical undulators have a magnetic field on the axis  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r } { \\vec { B } ( z ) = \\vec { u } _ { x } B _ { 0 } \\cos ( k _ { u } z ) - \\vec { u } _ { y } B _ { 0 } \\sin ( k _ { u } z ) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n A rigorous analytic discussion of helical undulators is somewhat easier since the longitudinal component of the electron velocity $v _ { z } = \\beta _ { z } c$ is constant. Planar undulators, however, are much more common in  \n synchrotron radiation facilities, therefore we will continue our discussion using a magnetic field according to Equation I.10.13.  \n The magnetic field exerts a force on the electron  \n $$\nm _ { e } \\gamma \\frac { \\mathrm { d } \\vec { v } } { \\mathrm { d } t } = \\vec { F } = - e \\vec { v } \\times \\vec { B }\n$$ \n that results in a transverse oscillation of the particle  \n $$\nm _ { e } \\gamma \\frac { \\mathrm { d } v _ { x } } { \\mathrm { d } t } = e v _ { z } B _ { y } = e v _ { z } B _ { 0 } \\sin ( k _ { u } z ) .\n$$ \n In the following, we replace the independent variable $t$ by the longitudinal position $z$ . Thus, the equation can be written as a derivative with respect to $z$ , using $\\mathrm { d } z / \\mathrm { d } t = v _ { z }$  \n $$\n\\frac { \\mathrm { d } v _ { x } } { \\mathrm { d } z } = \\frac { e } { m _ { e } \\gamma } B _ { 0 } \\sin ( k _ { u } z ) .\n$$ \n The relativistic $\\gamma$ -factor of a particle is constant in a static magnetic field. Integration of the equation leads to  \n $$\nv _ { x } ( z ) = \\beta _ { z } ( z ) c = - \\frac { K c } { \\gamma } \\cos ( k _ { u } z ) ,\n$$ \n where a dimensionless undulator parameter has been introduced,  \n $$\nK = \\frac { e B _ { 0 } } { m _ { e } c k _ { u } } .\n$$ \n The electron follows a sinusoidal trajectory  \n $$\nx ( z ) = - \\frac { K } { k _ { u } \\gamma \\beta _ { z } } \\sin ( k _ { u } z ) .\n$$ \n Synchrotron radiation is emitted by relativistic electrons in a cone with opening angle of approximately $\\frac { 1 } { \\gamma }$ (Equation I.10.7). In an undulator, the maximum angle of the particle velocity with respect to the undulator axis $\\begin{array} { r } { \\alpha = \\arctan ( \\frac { v _ { x } } { v _ { z } } ) } \\end{array}$ is always smaller than the opening angle of the radiation, therefore the radiation field may add coherently.  \n Consider two photons emitted by a single electron at the points $A$ and $B$ , which are one half undulator period apart (see Fig. I.10.5)  \n $$\n\\overline { { A B } } = \\frac { \\lambda _ { u } } { 2 } .\n$$ \n If the phase of the radiation wave advances by $\\pi$ between $A$ and $B$ , the electromagnetic field of the radiation adds coherently3. The light moves on a straight line $\\overline { { A B } }$ that is slightly shorter than the sinusoidal electron trajectory $\\widetilde { A B }$  \n $$\n{ \\frac { \\lambda } { 2 c } } = { \\frac { \\widetilde { A B } } { v } } - { \\frac { \\overline { { A B } } } { c } } .\n$$ \n The electron travels on a sinusoidal arc of length $\\widetilde { A B }$ that can be calculated as  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } { \\overrightarrow { A B } } & { = \\displaystyle \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } \\sqrt { 1 + \\left( \\frac { \\mathrm { d } x } { \\mathrm { d } \\xi } \\right) ^ { 2 } } \\mathrm { d } z } \\\\ & { \\approx \\displaystyle \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } \\left( 1 + \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\left( \\frac { \\mathrm { d } x } { \\mathrm { d } \\xi } \\right) ^ { 2 } \\right) \\mathrm { d } z } \\\\ & { = \\displaystyle \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } \\left( 1 - \\frac { K ^ { 2 } } { 2 \\sqrt { 3 \\xi _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } } } \\mathrm { e } ^ { \\mathrm { i } \\xi } \\mathrm { d } \\xi \\right) \\mathrm { d } z } \\\\ & { = \\displaystyle \\int _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } \\left( 1 - \\frac { K ^ { 2 } } { 2 \\sqrt { 3 \\xi _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } } } \\mathrm { e } ^ { \\mathrm { i } \\xi } \\mathrm { d } \\xi \\right) \\mathrm { d } z } \\\\ & { = \\displaystyle \\frac { \\lambda _ { 0 } } { 2 } \\left( 1 + \\frac { K ^ { 2 } } { 4 ( 3 \\xi _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } ) } \\right) } \\\\ & { \\approx \\displaystyle \\frac { \\lambda _ { 0 } } { 2 } \\left( 1 + \\frac { K ^ { 2 } } { 4 \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\right) . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Equation (I.10.16) becomes  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\lambda } { 2 c } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\lambda _ { u } } { 2 \\beta c } \\left( 1 + \\frac { K ^ { 2 } } { 4 \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\right) - \\frac { \\lambda _ { u } } { 2 c } } } \\\\ { { \\Longrightarrow } } & { { \\lambda } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { \\lambda _ { u } } { 2 \\gamma ^ { 2 } } ( 1 + K ^ { 2 } / 2 ) , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where we have used $\\beta = \\textstyle \\sqrt { 1 - \\gamma ^ { - 2 } } \\approx 1 - \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\gamma ^ { - 2 }$ for $\\gamma \\gg 1$ . Radiation emitted at this wavelength adds up coherently in the forward direction. More generally, the radiation adds up coherently at all odd harmonics $n = 2 m - 1 , m \\in \\mathbb { N }$  \n $$\n\\lambda _ { n } = \\frac { \\lambda _ { u } } { 2 n \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\left( 1 + \\frac { K ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \\right) ,\n$$ \n while we have destructive interference for even harmonics $n = 2 m , m \\in \\mathbb { N }$ . If we observe the radiation  \n under a small angle $\\vartheta$ from the beam axis, the emission is slightly red-shifted  \n $$\n\\lambda = \\frac { \\lambda _ { u } } { 2 \\gamma ^ { 2 } } \\left( 1 + \\frac { K ^ { 2 } } { 2 } + \\vartheta ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } \\right) .\n$$ \n As you can see, since $\\vartheta ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } > 0$ , the wavelength increases the further away from the axis it is observed. the angular width $\\Delta \\vartheta$ of the radiation cone is inversely proportional to the distance $L$ traveled by the radiation: $\\begin{array} { r } { \\Delta \\theta \\propto \\frac { 1 } { L } } \\end{array}$ . This occurs because the wavefronts from different points of the trajectory become more aligned the farther they travel, effectively narrowing the observed radiation cone.  \n Two important aspects:  \n – The photon energy is proportional to the square of the energy of the electrons; – The photon energy decreases with higher magnetic field.4  \n We are looking at spontaneous radiation, thus the total energy loss of the electrons is proportional to the distance travelled. Consequently, the total intensity of the radiation grows proportionally to the distance travelled. The width of the radiation cone for the fundamental wavelength decreases inversely proportional to the distance, therefore the central intensity grows as the square of the undulator length. The radiation is linearly polarized in $x$ direction.  \n Undulators thus make use of the coherent enhancement of the radiation of each electron individually, which leads to a substantial increase in brillance (Equation I.10.1). This coherence occurs at specific wavelengths, which can be tuned by adjusting the strength of the magnetic field5, and occurs in a very narrow angle around the forward direction. Free electron lasers achieve an additional coherent enhancement from multiple electrons in each microbunch, which results in another supercalifragilisticexpialidocious enhancement in the peak brilliance.  \n To compute the brillance of the radiation from an undulator, one first has to determine the flux $\\dot { N } _ { \\gamma }$ and the effective source size $\\boldsymbol { \\sigma } _ { ( x , y ) \\mathrm { e f f } }$ and divergence $\\sigma _ { ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } ) , \\mathrm { e f f } }$ . These are given by the electron beam size $\\sigma _ { ( x , y ) }$ and divergence $\\sigma _ { ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } ) }$ , and the diffraction limit for the radiation. Electron beam size and divergence can be calculated from the Twiss parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ , and the emittance $\\varepsilon$ of the beam. The diffraction limits for the radiation $\\sigma _ { r }$ and $\\sigma _ { r ^ { \\prime } }$ can be calculated, considering the length of the source (which is equal to the undulator length) $L$  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { { \\displaystyle \\sigma _ { r } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { 4 \\pi } \\sqrt { \\lambda L } } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle \\sigma _ { r ^ { \\prime } } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\sqrt { \\frac { \\lambda } { L } } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n This diffraction limit is symmetric in $x$ and $y$ . The effective source size is  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { \\sigma _ { ( x , y ) , \\mathrm { e f f } } } & { = } & { \\sqrt { \\sigma _ { ( x , y ) } ^ { 2 } + \\sigma _ { r } ^ { 2 } } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { \\sigma _ { ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } ) , \\mathrm { e f f } } } & { = } & { \\sqrt { \\sigma _ { ( x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime } ) } ^ { 2 } + \\sigma _ { r ^ { \\prime } } ^ { 2 } } . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Computing the photon flux $\\dot { N } _ { \\gamma }$ for an undulator is even more elaborate than the calculation for a single dipole, and we just cite the result [2]  \n $$\n{ \\dot { N } } _ { \\gamma } = 1 . 4 3 \\cdot 1 0 ^ { 1 4 } N I _ { b } Q _ { n } ( K ) ,\n$$ \n where  \n $$\nQ _ { n } ( K ) = \\frac { 1 + K ^ { 2 } / 2 } { n } F _ { n } ( K ) .\n$$ \n We denote the harmonic number by $n = 2 m - 1$ with $m \\in \\mathbb { N }$ , the number of periods in the undulator by $N$ , the beam current in A by $I _ { b }$ , the undulator parameter by $K$ , and $F _ { n } ( K )$ is given by  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { { F _ { n } ( K ) } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { n ^ { 2 } K ^ { 2 } } { ( 1 + K ^ { 2 } / 2 ) ^ { 2 } } \\left( J _ { ( n + 1 ) / 2 } ( Y ) - J _ { ( n - 1 ) / 2 } ( Y ) \\right) ^ { 2 } } } \\\\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\\\ { { Y } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { n K ^ { 2 } } { 4 ( 1 + K ^ { 2 } / 2 ) } , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $J$ is the Bessel function of the first kind.  \n As $K$ increases, the higher harmonics play a more signicificant role, but the fundamental harmonic always has the highest flux.  \n I.10.3 Effects of the emission of radiation on beam dynamics  \n In this section, we will delve deeper into the interplay between the radiation emission and the ensuing dynamics of the beam. The treatment closely follows the book by Wolski [4]. First, we will explore the energy transfer that occurs when an electron emits a photon. Following this, we will make a coordinate transformation to the more beneficial action and angle variables, providing a clearer perspective on the underlying mechanisms. We will then proceed to compute the ensemble average to calculate the implications on the emittance of the beam. A noteworthy observation will emerge from our analysis: the emittance decreases exponentially, plateauing at a limit dictated by the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. This revelation underscores the intricate ties between quantum mechanics and relativistic beam dynamics, shedding light on the broader consequences of radiation emission in storage rings.  \n In the following sections, we will make use of Hamiltonian mechanics. Those not familiar with this matter are invited to watch two introductory videos: \"Hamiltonian formalism $1 ^ { \\dag 6 }$ and \"Hamiltonian formalism 2\"7.  \n I.10.3.1 Vertical damping  \n To begin, we will focus our attention on the vertical coordinate $y$ ; it turns out that this is the simplest case. We will look at one electron in the bunch, and choose the canonical variables $y$ for position (measured relative to the reference orbit) and $p _ { y }$ to denote vertical momentum.  \n  \n Let us consider an electron possessing a momentum $p$ . Upon the emission of a photon with momentum $d p$ , there is an associated change in momentum, which we will represent as $- d p$ . As we have seen before, it is an intrinsic property of radiation emission by relativistic particles that it predominantly occurs in the forward direction. It is therefore a useful approximation to consider the momentum of the electron $p$ and the emitted photon $d p$ to be collinear. This collinearity is depicted in Fig. I.10.6.  \n The new momentum of the electron is then  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { { \\vec { p ^ { \\prime } } } } & { { = } } & { { \\vec { p } - d \\vec { p } } } \\\\ { { } } & { { \\approx } } & { { \\vec { p } - \\displaystyle \\frac { \\vec { p ^ { \\prime } } } { P _ { 0 } } d p } } \\\\ { { } } & { { = } } & { { \\vec { p } \\left( 1 - \\displaystyle \\frac { d \\vec { p ^ { \\prime } } } { P _ { 0 } } \\right) , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $P _ { 0 }$ is the momentum of the reference particle. Since $\\vec { p }$ and $d \\vec { p }$ are collinear, the same relation can be written for the $y$ component of $\\vec { p }$ , $p _ { y }$  \n $$\np _ { y } ^ { \\prime } \\approx p _ { y } \\left( 1 - \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } \\right) .\n$$ \n In order to analyze the effect on the beam, it becomes appropriate to transition to a more beneficial set of coordinates. Specifically, we will use the action and angle variables $J _ { y }$ and $\\varphi _ { y }$ . It is essential to underscore that these coordinates are not arbitrary choices; they too are canonical variables. Their significance lies in their ability to offer a more structured view into the dynamics of the entire beam.  \n The action $J _ { y }$ is, by its definition  \n $$\nJ _ { y } = \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\gamma _ { y } y ^ { 2 } + \\alpha _ { y } y p _ { y } + \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\beta _ { y } p _ { y } ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n After the emission of a photon, the action of our single electron is  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { { J _ { y } ^ { \\prime } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\gamma _ { y } y ^ { 2 } + \\alpha _ { y } y p _ { y } \\left( 1 - \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } \\right) + \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\beta _ { y } p _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\left( 1 - \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } } \\\\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\\\ { { } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\gamma _ { y } y ^ { 2 } + \\alpha _ { y } y p _ { y } - \\alpha _ { y } y p _ { y } \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } + \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\beta _ { y } p _ { y } ^ { 2 } - 2 \\cdot \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\beta _ { y } p _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } + \\frac { 1 } { 2 } \\beta p _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\left( \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n The change in action is thus  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l l l } { { d J _ { y } } } & { { = } } & { { J _ { y } ^ { \\prime } - J _ { y } } } \\\\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\\\ { { } } & { { \\approx } } & { { \\displaystyle - \\alpha _ { y } y p _ { y } \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } - \\beta _ { y } p _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } } } \\\\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\\\ { { } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle - \\left( \\alpha _ { y } y p _ { y } + \\beta _ { y } p _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\right) \\frac { d p } { P _ { 0 } } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Shifting our view to a broader perspective, we now consider the properties of the entire electron bunch. By definition, the emittance is given as the ensemble average of the action. The change in emittance follows thus from the change in action  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { d \\varepsilon _ { y } } & { = } & { \\langle d J _ { y } \\rangle } \\\\ & { = } & { - \\langle \\alpha _ { y } \\underbrace { \\langle g p _ { y } \\rangle } _ { = - \\alpha _ { y } \\varepsilon _ { y } } + \\beta _ { y } \\underbrace { \\langle p _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\rangle } _ { = \\gamma _ { \\mathrm { t r } } \\varepsilon _ { y } } \\frac { \\partial p _ { \\mathrm { t } } } { \\partial P _ { 0 } } } \\\\ & & { - \\langle - \\alpha _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\varepsilon _ { y } + \\beta _ { y } \\gamma _ { y } \\varepsilon _ { y } \\rangle \\frac { \\partial p _ { \\mathrm { t } } } { \\partial P _ { 0 } } } \\\\ & { = } & { - \\varepsilon _ { y } \\langle \\underbrace { \\delta _ { y } \\gamma _ { y } } _ { \\mathrm { 1 } } - \\alpha _ { y } ^ { 2 } \\rangle \\frac { d p _ { \\mathrm { f } } } { P _ { 0 } } } \\\\ & & { - \\varepsilon _ { y } \\frac { d p _ { \\mathrm { f } } } { D _ { 0 } } , } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where we have used the Twiss parameter identity $\\alpha _ { y } ^ { 2 } = \\beta _ { y } \\gamma _ { y }$ . The change in emittance is thus proportional to the emittance, with a proportionality factor $- d p / P _ { 0 }$ . We thus have an exponentially decreasing emittance (the factor 2 is by convention)  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { y } ( t ) = \\varepsilon _ { y } ( 0 ) \\cdot \\exp \\left( - 2 \\frac { t } { \\tau _ { y } } \\right) .\n$$ \n This result underscores the value of the chosen variable transformation. By using action and angle variables, we can get an understanding of a key characteristic of the electron bunch: its emittance. This variable transformation is not just a mathematical maneuver; it serves as a powerful tool, offering clarity and depth to our exploration.  \n Note that we assume the momentum of the photon to be much smaller than the reference momentum. As a result, we see a slow (i.e. an adiabatic) damping of the emittance.  \n To proceed our determination of the vertical damping time, i.e. the decay constant of the emittance, we need to quantify the energy lost by a particle due to synchrotron radiation for each turn in the storage  \n ring. We start with the radiation power  \n $$\nP _ { \\gamma } = \\frac { C _ { \\gamma } } { 2 \\pi } c \\frac { E ^ { 4 } } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } .\n$$ \n As the energy spread and the change in energy around one turn will be small, we can replace the particle energy $E$ by the nominal energy $E _ { \\mathrm { n o m } }$ .  \n The emission of synchrotron radiation leads to a decrease in the energy of the particles within a storage ring. In order to maintain these particles within the beam pipe, it is imperative to counterbalance this energy loss. This compensation is achieved using radio frequency (RF) cavities. These cavities are specifically designed to accelerate particles in the forward direction, ensuring their continued trajectory within the ring. The $y$ component of the momentum is thus unchanged. In Fig. I.10.6, the momentum of a particle, after undergoing energy diminution due to radiation emission and subsequent re-acceleration by the RF cavities, is denoted as $p ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ .  \n Let us get back to the change of emittance in one turn  \n $$\nd \\varepsilon _ { y } = - \\varepsilon _ { y } \\frac { U _ { 0 } } { E _ { \\mathrm { { n o m } } } } .\n$$ \n Using the revolution period $T _ { 0 }$  \n $$\n\\frac { d \\varepsilon _ { y } } { d t } = - \\varepsilon _ { y } \\frac { U _ { 0 } } { E _ { \\mathrm { n o m } } T _ { 0 } } .\n$$ \n The damping time is thus  \n $$\n\\tau _ { y } = 2 \\frac { E _ { \\mathrm { { n o m } } } } { U _ { 0 } } T _ { 0 } .\n$$ \n We use the (classical) result from Equation I.10.9 for the power radiated by a particle of charge $e$ and energy $E _ { \\mathrm { n o m } }$ . Integrating around the ring, we have the energy loss per turn  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { l l l } { { U _ { 0 } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\oint P _ { \\gamma } d t } } \\\\ { { } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\oint \\frac { 1 } { c } P _ { \\gamma } d s } } \\\\ { { } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { C _ { \\gamma } } { 2 \\pi } E _ { \\mathrm { n o m } } ^ { 4 } \\oint \\frac { 1 } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } d s . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n For a synchrotron consisting of only dipoles  \n $$\n\\oint { \\frac { 1 } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } } d s = { \\frac { 2 \\pi \\rho } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } } = { \\frac { 2 \\pi } { \\rho } } .\n$$ \n More generally, we use the second synchrotron radiation integral as defined in Equation I.10.12, and we can write the energy loss per turn as a function of $I _ { 2 }$  \n $$\nU _ { 0 } = \\frac { C _ { \\gamma } } { 2 \\pi } E _ { \\mathrm { n o m } } ^ { 4 } I _ { 2 } .\n$$ \n Notice that $I _ { 2 }$ is a property of the lattice (actually, a property of the reference trajectory), and does not depend on the properties of the beam.  \n The emittance evolves as  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { y } ( t ) = \\varepsilon _ { y } ( 0 ) \\exp \\left( - 2 \\frac { t } { \\tau _ { y } } \\right) .\n$$ \n From this, it follows that the emittance decreases exponentially, asymptotically approaching zero. This phenomenon is termed radiation damping. While radiation damping plays a key role in influencing the emittance of the beam in a synchrotron, there exist other factors and effects that counterbalance its influence. These countering mechanisms ensure that the emittance does not perpetually decline due to the sole influence of radiation damping, but that it reaches a non-zero equilibrium value. Before diving into these balancing effects, we turn our attention to the horizontal plane, examining its unique characteristics and dynamics in the context of our ongoing analysis.  \n I.10.3.2 Horizontal damping  \n When considering the horizontal phase space $( x , p _ { x } )$ , the situation is slightly more complicated. The primary factor contributing to this complexity is the dispersion, which introduces a coupling between the horizontal motion and the longitudinal phase space $( z , \\delta )$ . Notably, in regions where the reference trajectory is curved, such as within dipoles, the path length undertaken by a particle depends on its horizontal position relative to the reference trajectory. Further complicating matters, in accelerators where combined-function magnets are used, the dipole fields have a transverse gradient, thus the vertical magnetic field is influenced by its horizontal position.  \n The coupling between longitudinal and horizontal phase spaces in a beam is characterized by the dispersion $\\eta _ { x } ~ = ~ \\partial x / \\partial \\delta$ and the dispersion derivative $\\eta _ { p x } = \\partial \\eta _ { x } / \\partial z$ . The canonic variables for the horizontal phase space are then given by  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { x } & { = } & { \\sqrt { 2 \\beta _ { x } J _ { x } } \\cos \\varphi _ { x } + \\eta _ { x } \\delta } \\\\ { p _ { x } } & { = } & { \\displaystyle - \\sqrt { \\frac { 2 J _ { x } } { \\beta _ { x } } } ( \\sin \\varphi _ { x } + \\alpha _ { x } \\cos \\varphi _ { x } ) + \\eta _ { p x } \\delta . } \\end{array}\n$$ \n When deriving the equations for the beam dynamics in the horizontal phase space, we need to consider:  \n – Change in momentum: the emission of radiation leads to a recoil of the electron. This change in momentum is the same that we considered in the vertical phase space;   \n– Dispersion: the emission of radiation results in a change in the energy deviation, denoted as $\\delta$ . This deviation brings about subsequent changes in the horizontal coordinate $x$ and its associated momentum $p _ { x }$ .  \n When we explored the beam dynamics in the vertical phase space, we ignored the second factor, as we assumed that the vertical dispersion is zero. This assumption streamlined the analysis, but it can certainly not be made in the horizontal dimension.  \n While the details of the interplay between the emission of synchrotron radiation and the damping of the emittance are unique to each plane, the outcomes are similar. The horizontal emittance decays exponentially  \n $$\n\\frac { d \\varepsilon _ { x } } { d t } = - \\frac { 2 } { \\tau _ { x } } \\varepsilon _ { x }\n$$ \n $$\n\\Rightarrow \\varepsilon _ { x } ( t ) = \\varepsilon _ { x } ( 0 ) \\exp \\left( - 2 \\frac { t } { \\tau _ { x } } \\right)\n$$ \n with a horizontal damping time  \n $$\n\\tau _ { x } = \\frac { 2 } { j _ { x } } \\frac { E _ { 0 } } { U _ { 0 } } T _ { 0 } .\n$$ \n All effects related to the dispersion are summarized in the horizontal partition number $j _ { x }$  \n $$\nj _ { x } = 1 - { \\frac { I _ { 4 } } { I _ { 2 } } } .\n$$ \n The second synchrotron radiation integral is defined in Equation I.10.12. For the sake of completeness, we now define all five synchrotron radiation integrals  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { { I _ { 1 } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\oint \\frac { \\eta _ { x } } { \\rho } d s } } \\\\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\\\ { { I _ { 2 } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\oint \\frac { 1 } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } d s } } \\\\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\\\ { { I _ { 3 } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\oint \\frac { 1 } { | \\rho | ^ { 3 } } d s } } \\\\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\\\ { { I _ { 4 } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\oint \\frac { \\eta _ { x } } { \\rho } \\left( \\frac { 1 } { \\rho ^ { 2 } } + 2 k _ { 1 } \\right) d s , \\qquad k _ { 1 } = \\frac { e } { P _ { 0 } } \\frac { \\partial B _ { y } } { \\partial x } } } \\\\ { { } } & { { } } & { { } } \\\\ { { I _ { 5 } } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\oint \\frac { \\hat { \\mathcal { H } } _ { x } } { | \\rho | ^ { 3 } } d s , ~ \\qquad \\mathcal { H } _ { x } = \\gamma _ { x } \\eta _ { x } ^ { 2 } + 2 \\alpha _ { x } \\eta _ { x } \\eta _ { \\rho x } + \\beta _ { x } \\eta _ { p x } ^ { 2 } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n All synchrotron radiation integrals are a function of the lattice, independent of the properties of the stored beam.  \n Again, Equation I.10.32 would predict an emittance that decays exponentially, approaching zero. The reason that this does not happen in reality is that there are effects that increase the horizontal emittance and thus result in a non-zero equilibrium emittance. We will soon look at these effects, but not before examining the longitudinal phase space.  \n I.10.3.3 Longitudinal damping  \n We will now look at the effect of synchrotron radiation on the longitudinal phase space $( z , \\delta )$ . Electrons that have a larger energy than the reference particle radiate more, while those that have smaller energy radiate less. This leads to a damping of the oscillations in the longitudinal phase space (the so-called synchrotron oscillations), and the longitudinal emittance, i.e. the phase space volume of the beam, decays exponentially.  \n This phase space is again coupled to the horizontal phase space, for the reasons mentioned above. Finding the damping time, one follows a derivation similar as in the vertical phase space:  \n – Write down the equations of motion of a single electron in the longitudinal phase space, including losses through synchrotron radiation;   \n– Express the energy loss per turn as a function of $\\delta$ . The fact that this influences the radiation power introduces longitudinal damping;   \n– Note that the revolution period depends on the energy of the particle, with higher energy particles  \n taking longer for one turn8;  \n – Solving the equations of motion gives synchrotron oscillations with an amplitude that decays exponentially; – Finally, we take the ensemble average to find the longitudinal emittance.  \n This results in an exponentially decaying longitudinal emittance  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { z } ( t ) = \\varepsilon _ { z } ( 0 ) \\exp \\left( - 2 \\frac { t } { \\tau _ { z } } \\right) ,\n$$ \n with a damping time  \n $$\n\\tau _ { z } = \\frac { 2 } { j _ { z } } \\frac { E _ { 0 } } { U _ { 0 } } T _ { 0 } ,\n$$ \n where the longitudinal damping partition number $j _ { z }$ is given by  \n $$\nj _ { z } = 2 + { \\frac { I _ { 4 } } { I _ { 2 } } } .\n$$ \n I.10.3.4 Quantum excitation  \n Finally, we are ready to look at effects that increase the emittance of the beam. While radiation damping inherently reduces emittance, there exist concurrent processes and phenomena that act in opposition, increasing the emittance. When such effects are integrated into our analysis, these emittance-increasing effects can counterbalance the radiation damping. As a consequence of this dynamic equilibrium between damping and amplifying factors, the beam stabilizes at a non-zero equilibrium emittance. This state represents a balance where the rate of emittance reduction due to radiation damping is compensated by the rate of emittance growth from other processes.  \n Let us first consider the horizontal phase space. An electron emitting an X-ray photon receives an equal and opposite recoil momentum. This quantized emission process is inherently stochastic, leading to fluctuations in the energy of individual electrons. As a consequence of these quantum fluctuations, the momentum change due to the emission of individual photons thus increases the horizontal emittance. The process is further amplified by the dispersion of the lattice.  \n Including the effects of radiation damping and quantum excitation, the emittance in the horizontal plane varies as  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { x } ( t ) = \\varepsilon _ { x } ( 0 ) \\exp { \\left( - 2 \\frac { t } { \\tau _ { x } } \\right) } + \\varepsilon _ { x } ( \\infty ) \\left[ 1 - \\exp { \\left( - 2 \\frac { t } { \\tau _ { x } } \\right) } \\right]\n$$ \n and the equilibrium value, also called the natural horizontal emittance is  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { x } ( \\infty ) = C _ { q } \\gamma ^ { 2 } \\frac { I _ { 5 } } { j _ { x } I _ { 2 } } ,\n$$ \n where the fifth synchrotron radiation integral $I _ { 5 }$ is defined in Equation I.10.35, and the electron quantum constant $C _ { q }$ is  \n $$\nC _ { q } = \\frac { 5 5 } { 3 2 \\sqrt { 3 } } \\frac { \\hbar } { m _ { e } c } \\approx 3 . 8 3 2 \\cdot 1 0 ^ { - 1 3 } \\mathrm { m } .\n$$ \n (The factor $\\frac { 5 5 } { 3 2 { \\sqrt { 3 } } }$ comes from the calculation of the emission spectrum of synchrotron radiation, integrating over all photon energies and angles).  \n A similar effect occurs in the longitudinal phase space. An electron emitting an X-ray photon loses a small, but significant fraction of its energy. This induces an energy spread among the electrons in the bunches. This energy spread, in tandem with the action of dispersion in the accelerator, results in an increase in the longitudinal phase space distribution, thereby increasing the longitudinal emittance of the beam. Quantum excitation thus acts as a natural counterpart to radiation damping.  \n The natural energy spread $\\Delta E / E$ is given by  \n $$\n\\frac { \\Delta E } { E } = \\sqrt { \\frac { C _ { q } \\gamma ^ { 2 } } { 2 j _ { z } \\langle \\rho \\rangle } } ,\n$$ \n where $\\langle \\rho \\rangle$ is the average radius of curvature in the storage ring.  \n Finally, in the vertical phase space of accelerators, the dynamics are somewhat different than in the horizontal or longitudinal phase spaces. This is primarily because of typically negligible dispersion in the vertical plane, and because this phase space is typically not coupled to the other dimensions. This means that, under normal conditions, variations in the energy of a particle do not significantly affect its vertical position. However, that does not exempt the vertical phase space from the effects of quantum excitation. Three effects remain that counterbalance radiation damping even in the vertical plane:  \n – A (small) vertical component of the emitted photon, – Intra-beam scattering, – A remnant coupling between the horizontal and vertical plane.  \n In most accelerators, the last point usually dominates, despite a careful set-up of the accelerator lattice that avoids coupling terms.  \n It is worth noting that quantum effects determine macroscopic effects such as the beam size in a synchrotron. In fact, the value of Planck’s constant $\\hbar$ has just the right magnitude to make practical the construction of large electron synchrotrons [3].  \n I.10.3.5 Some observations  \n I.10.3.5.1 Dependence of damping times on particle energy and type  \n As you can see in Equation I.10.9, the radiation power emitted by a charged particle circulating in a storage ring is inversely proportional to the fourth power of its mass, for a given energy. This fundamental relationship has profound implications for the damping times observed in electron versus proton accelerators. Electron storage rings have typically damping times on the order of tens of milliseconds. Protons, in contrast, typically emit a negligible amount of synchrotron radiation at the same energy. Consequently, the damping times of proton accelerators extend much longer, often on the order of days. In these cases, damping may typically be neglected, and the beam emittance remains constant for stored beams.  \n I.10.3.5.2 Top-up injection  \n Radiation damping, a distinctive feature in electron accelerators, facilitates an innovative operational mode known as top-up injection. In this mode, rather than filling the storage ring once and then gradually losing beam current due to scattering and other losses, the bunches stored in the accelerator continually or periodically receive additional charges. New particles are injected close to the existing bunches in phase space. Due to the presence of radiation damping, these freshly injected particles rapidly lose their excess emittance through the emission of synchrotron radiation, thereby reducing their oscillations around the ideal orbit. Consequently, they are effectively ‘sucked into’ the main beam, seamlessly integrating with the stored bunches.  \n This method contrasts with traditional filling schemes, where the beam intensity peaks right after a fill and then continuously diminishes. Top-up injection maintains a nearly constant beam current, equilibrating thermal load and thereby improving the stability of the beam over extended periods. Such consistency is particularly advantageous for user experiments, because the electron beam emits in an X-ray beam that is constant in intensity and pointing, offering more uniform conditions and reliable data. Furthermore, the ability to maintain optimal beam conditions without ramping the lattice during acceleration enhances overall time available for experiments. For this reason, virtually all modern synchrotrons make use of top-up injection (see Fig. I.10.7).  \n I.10.3.5.3 Robinson theorem  \n If we take the sum of all three partition damping numbers, noting that $\\begin{array} { r } { j _ { x } = 1 - \\frac { I _ { 4 } } { I _ { 2 } } } \\end{array}$ , $\\begin{array} { r } { j _ { z } = 2 + \\frac { I _ { 4 } } { I _ { 2 } } } \\end{array}$ , and using $j _ { y } = 1$ as the vertical damping does not depend on the synchrotron radiation integrals, we can derive the Robinson theorem, which states that the sum of the partition numbers is 4  \n $$\nj _ { x } + j _ { y } + j _ { z } = 4 .\n$$ \n This means that the damping is not uniformly distributed along the three sub-spaces of the phase space (horizontal, vertical and longitudinal), but it is split according to specific partition numbers. These partition numbers are determined by the accelerator lattice, which gives the designers of accelerators some freedom to optimize the damping times.  \n I.10.4 Diffraction limited storage rings  \n The pursuit of higher brilliance and coherence is a driving force in the development of synchrotrons. As we have seen above, while the emission of synchrotron radiation reduces the transverse emittance of the beams in an electron synchrotron, the quantum nature of the radiation imposes a limit on how small the beam will become, and thus set a ceiling on the achievable brilliance. The source size of the $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray beam is given by the electron beam size in the undulators. We have seen in Section I.10.3.4 that the vertical emittance is typically significantly smaller than the horizontal emittance. The vertical beam size is indeed typically so small that the X-ray beams are diffraction-limited in this dimension.  \n The term diffraction-limited refers to a system, typically in optics or imaging, where the resolution or image detail is primarily restricted by the fundamental diffraction of light rather than by imperfections or aberrations in the source, or in imaging components. In such a system, the performance reaches the theoretical physical limit dictated by the wave nature of the radiation. Achieving diffraction-limited performance means maximizing image sharpness and detail by minimizing all other sources of distortion or blurring to the extent that diffraction becomes the overriding factor in limiting resolution.  \n The horizontal emittance, conversely, is typically an order of magnitude larger. The X-ray beams are thus not diffraction-limited in this dimension. Diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs) overcome these constraints by minimizing the horizontal emittance to a level such that horizontal and vertical beam sizes in the undulators are similar. The diffraction limit of the X-ray beam thus becomes the defining factor for the source size, which leads to beams that are transversely fully coherent. This increased coherence translates into improved resolution and contrast in experimental techniques like X-ray imaging and scattering.  \n The implications of achieving diffraction-limited performance are profound. The significantly improved coherence of the X-ray beams allow scientists to use the full beam for diffraction experiments, opening doors to previously intractable scientific questions. We will now see how this is achieved, and discuss briefly the challenges for design, construction and operation.  \n Equation I.10.40 gives the natural horizontal emittance of the beam. A deeper inspection reveals that the main contributions to the emittance growth occur in regions where the dispersion $\\eta _ { x }$ is large and the radius of curvature $\\rho$ is small, i.e. the magnetic field $B$ is large. This makes intuitively sense. An emission of a hard X-ray photon occurs predominantly in strong magnetic fields. If this coincides with a large dispersion, the effect on the beam emittance is maximized, as the electron losing energy is now on the wrong orbit for its energy.  \n It is obviously impossible to build a storage ring without dispersion, or without magnetic fields. A careful design of the lattice can nevertheless minimize emittance growth in dipoles:  \n – Multi-bend achromats: unlike traditional designs that use one or two bend magnets after each straight section, a multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice employs multiple bending magnets, interleaved with quadrupoles and sextupoles that correct for the chromaticity. The quadrupoles re-focus the beam periodically, keeping the dispersion small. By dividing the total bending angle among several magnets, the strength of each magnet can be reduced, leading to less radiation emission per bend and thus to a smaller horizontal emittance;  \n  \n – Longitudinal gradient bends: these are dipole magnets whose magnetic field varies along their length. By providing a variable field strength along the bend, longitudinal gradient bends (LGBs) concentrate the highest magnetic field in the middle, where the dispersion reaches a minimum. This further reduces the horizontal emittance, making diffraction-limited designs possible even for small storage rings;  \n – Reverse bends: these are dipoles that have the opposite magnetic field of the regular dipoles, effectively bending the beam outwards. By carefully configuring the reverse bends, designers can disentangle horizontal focusing from dispersion matching, achieving a net reduction in beam dispersion.  \n Combining MBAs with LGBs and reverse bends, designers can achieve a lower horizontal emittance. For the case of SLS 2.0, the reduction in emittance is a factor 25. The combination of longitudinal gradient bends with reverse bends is shown in Fig. I.10.8.  \n Technical and beam dynamics considerations for diffraction-limited storage rings:  \n – Magnet design: DLSRs require a significantly more complex magnetic lattice compared to conventional storage rings. The magnetic elements in these lattices, including bending magnets, quadrupoles, and sextupoles, are not only more numerous but also often feature higher magnetic field strengths. The quadrupoles and sextupoles are therefore built with a smaller inner bore. Energy-efficient magnet designs employ permanent magnets for the basic lattice and use electromagnets only where tuning is necessary;  \n  \n – Vacuum system: as a result of the smaller inner bore of the magnets, the vacuum chamber diameter needs to be reduced to a point where a conventional pumping system becomes difficult to implement. A key enabling technology is the use of a distributed getter pump system, where the entire vacuum chamber is coated with a non-evaporable getter (NEG);  \n – Generation of hard X-rays: the strong field in longitudinal gradient bends, peaking at 4. . . 6 Tesla, results in very hard X-rays, up to a photon energy of $8 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ ;  \n – Momentum compaction factor: when designing a magnetic lattice that employs LGBs and reverse bends, one can achieve a situation where a higher-energy particle takes a shorter path. This can then result in a negative momentum compaction factor of the ring (like in proton synchrotrons below transition energy).  \n The Paul Scherrer Institut is upgrading its storage ring in the year 2024, making use of the principles outlined in this section [5].  \n I.10.5 Interaction of $\\mathbf { X }$ -rays with matter  \n In the subsequent sections, we will look at the interaction of X-rays with matter, and the use of X-rays for experiments. To understand the processes that lead to absorption, scattering, and diffraction, we will proceed in three steps, and look at the interaction of $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -rays with:  \n – Free electrons,   \n– Electrons bound to an atom, – Crystals.  \n The interaction of X-rays with matter is determined by the cross-section, which is itself proportional to the square of the so-called Thomson radius. The Thomson radius, in turn, is inversely proportional to the mass of the charged particle. Consequently, considering the substantial mass difference between protons and electrons, the interaction with protons can be ignored. Furthermore, neutrons, which have the same mass as protons but lack electric charge, so do not interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -rays. They can thus be entirely ignored.  \n The attenuation of $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -rays in matter can be described by Beer’s Law  \n $$\nI ( z ) = I _ { 0 } \\exp ( - \\mu z ) ,\n$$ \n where $\\mu$ is the attenuation coefficient. One commonly normalizes to the density $\\rho$ , and defines the mass attenuation coefficient as $\\mu / \\rho$ . Values for attenuation coefficient can be found in the $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray data booklet [6] or at https://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/atten2.html.  \n The relevant processes that contribute to the X-ray cross section are shown in Fig. I.10.9. Nuclear processes are only relevant for gamma rays, i.e. at photon energies far higher than what can be achieved by presently available synchrotrons. Pair production can occur only for photon energies above twice the electron rest energy, $2 \\times 5 1 1 \\mathrm { k e V } .$ The only processes relevant in synchrotrons are:  \n  \n – Photoelectric absorption: absorption by electrons bound to atoms;   \n– Thomson scattering: elastic scattering, i.e. scattering without energy transfer between the X-ray and a free electron;   \n– Compton scattering: inelastic scattering, where energy is transferred from the X-ray photon to an electron.  \n I.10.5.1 Interaction of X-rays with free electrons  \n Thomson scattering occurs when photons with an energy that is much lower than the binding energy of electrons in atoms interact with free or loosely bound electrons. The incident photons are then scattered elastically, i.e. there is no energy transfer between the X-ray photon and the electron. The photon wavelength is inversely proportional to its energy, thus it remains constant in an elastic process. A collision, however, implies in general a change in direction, thus the momentum $\\vec { k }$ of the photon will change its direction.  \n We can describe Thomson scattering by classical electromagnetism, considering a free electron that encounters an electromagnetic wave. The electron will start oscillating and radiate in all directions except the direction of the oscillation, with an intensity given by $I = I _ { 0 } \\cos ^ { 2 } \\vartheta$ . This re-radiated light has the same frequency as the incident light because the electron’s oscillation frequency is driven by the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, and there’s no energy loss in the system.  \n  \n The scattering amplitude $I _ { 0 }$ can be calculated from classic electromagnetism. For non-relativistic electrons, it is sufficient to consider the electric component of the incoming wave. The Thomson scattering cross section is equal to  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { T } = { \\frac { 8 \\pi } { 3 } } \\left( { \\frac { e ^ { 2 } } { 4 \\pi \\varepsilon _ { 0 } m _ { e } c ^ { 2 } } } \\right) ^ { 2 } = 0 . 6 \\cdot 1 0 ^ { - 2 8 } \\mathrm { { m } } = 0 . 6 \\mathrm { { b a r n } , }\n$$ \n independent of the wavelength of the incoming photon.  \n This is in contrast to Compton scattering, where we consider photons with an energy above a few $1 0 \\mathrm { k e V . }$ In this case, we have to consider quantum mechanical effects, and the photon transfers energy and momentum to the electron. The wavelength change of the scattered photon can be determined from the conservation of energy and momentum  \n $$\n\\Delta \\lambda = \\frac { h } { m _ { e } c } ( 1 - \\cos { \\vartheta } ) ,\n$$ \n where $\\vartheta$ is the angle at which the photon is scattered.  \n I.10.5.2 Scattering of $\\mathbf { X }$ -rays on atoms  \n In the case of photon energies less than a few keV, the wavelength is longer than the size of the atom. The scattering is then coherent, i.e., the phases of the scattered waves from different parts of the electron cloud add up constructively. The electric field amplitude of the scattered wave is then proportional to the total number of electrons in the atom $Z$ , and the scattered intensity is proportional to $Z ^ { 2 }$ . The total cross section is then  \n $$\n\\sigma = Z ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { T } .\n$$ \n The $Z ^ { 2 }$ dependence makes the scattering cross section for heavier atoms much larger compared to lighter ones, significantly influencing how $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -rays are used in science and medicine.  \n When we increase the photon energy, the wavelength becomes smaller than the size of the electron cloud of an atom, and decoherence between the scattered waves reduces the scattering cross section. As an approximation, the cross-section drops off as $1 / E _ { \\gamma } ^ { 2 }$ . The precise drop-off can be described by the atomic form factor $f ^ { 0 }$ , which depends on both the scattering angle and the photon wavelength. It can be parametrized as  \n $$\nf ^ { 0 } ( \\sin ( \\vartheta ) / \\lambda ) = \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 4 } a _ { i } \\exp \\left[ - b _ { i } \\left( \\frac { \\sin \\vartheta } { \\lambda } \\right) ^ { 2 } \\right] + c ,\n$$ \n where $a _ { 1 } , \\ldots , a _ { 4 } , b _ { 1 } , \\ldots , b _ { 4 }$ and $c$ are tabulated in the International Tables of Crystallography [7].  \n Different additional processes can occur when an $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray photon with a higher energy interacts with an electron bound to an atom:  \n – Refraction and reflection: similarly to the description of visible electromagnetic radiation, the elastic interaction between $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -rays and matter can be described by refraction and reflection. The index of refraction of most materials for X-rays is very close to, but slightly smaller than, one. This has some notable consequences: concave lenses focus an X-ray beam, but the focal length is very large; also, at very low angles of incidence (grazing angles), X-rays can be effectively reflected by total external reflection. This phenomenon is central to the design of X-ray mirrors;  \n  \n – Elastic scattering: in contrast to Thomson scattering, which occurs for free electrons, Rayleigh scattering describes the scattering on bound electrons, incorporating the quantum mechanical nature of the atoms;  \n – Inelastic scattering: while we looked at free electrons previously, Compton scattering can still occur with weakly bound electrons in heavier atoms where the binding energy is much lower than the energy of the incident X-ray photon;  \n – Photoelectric effect: when the energy of the incoming photon is greater than the binding energy of the electron in the atom, it can be completely absorbed, ejecting the bound electron (now referred to as a photoelectron) from the atom. The energy of the photoelectron is equal to the energy of the incident X-ray photon minus the binding energy of the electron in its original orbital;  \n – Absorption edges: the requirement that X-rays have a minimum energy to ionize an electron in a given orbital leads to the formation of absorption edges. These edges are specific to each element, and are widely used to characterize samples;  \n – Fluorescence: when an inner-shell electron is ejected (as in the photoelectric effect), an electron from a higher energy level falls into the lower energy vacancy, emitting an $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray photon with a characteristic energy specific to the atom;  \n – Auger electrons: similarly to fluorescence, this effect starts with the ionization or excitation of an inner-shell electron due to the interaction with the X-ray photon. This leaves a vacancy in the inner shell, which is then filled with an outer-shell electron. However, instead of releasing the excess energy as a photon, the energy is transferred non-radiatively to another outer-shell electron. This transfer of energy gives the second electron enough energy to be ejected from the atom, resulting in the emission of what is known as an Auger electron.  \n These processes are summarized in Fig. I.10.10.  \n Inelastic processes always lead to an energy deposition in the material, often leading to radiation damage, which limits the exposure time in many X-ray experiments.  \n I.10.5.3 Crystal diffraction  \n Imagine many atoms, arranged in a regular lattice, illuminated by a coherent $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -ray source. The elastic scattering on the electron clouds of these atoms will add constructively if all individual waves are in phase. This situation is shown in Fig. I.10.11. Considering a distance $d$ between the crystal planes, and referring to the notation in this figure, we get constructive interference when  \n $$\n( A B + B C ) - ( A C ^ { \\prime } ) = n \\lambda\n$$ \n for any natural number $n$ .  \n $$\nA B = B C = { \\frac { d } { \\sin \\vartheta } }\n$$ \n and  \n $$\n\\ A C = { \\frac { 2 d } { \\tan \\vartheta } } ,\n$$ \n from which follows  \n $$\nA C ^ { \\prime } = A C \\cos \\vartheta = { \\frac { 2 d } { \\tan \\vartheta } } \\cos \\vartheta = { \\frac { 2 d } { \\sin \\vartheta } } \\cos ^ { 2 } \\vartheta ,\n$$ \n and we conclude  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r c l } { { n \\lambda } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle \\frac { 2 d } { \\sin \\vartheta } - \\frac { 2 d } { \\tan \\vartheta } \\cos \\vartheta = \\displaystyle \\frac { 2 d } { \\sin \\vartheta } \\big ( 1 - \\cos ^ { 2 } \\vartheta \\big ) = \\displaystyle \\frac { 2 d } { \\sin \\vartheta } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\vartheta } } \\\\ { { } } & { { = } } & { { \\displaystyle 2 d \\sin \\vartheta , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n which is Bragg’s law. Note that contrary to the diffraction on a two-dimensional surface, which is often considered fir visible light, $\\mathrm { \\Delta } \\mathrm { X }$ -rays diffract on a three-dimensional crystal lattice. In this case, not only the exit angle matters, but also the incoming angle must fulfill the resonance condition!  \n X-ray diffraction is one of the key techniques to resolve molecular structure in samples that can be crystallized. In the following section, we will look at different applications of synchrotron radiation in science, medicine and industry.  \n I.10.6 Applications of synchrotron radiation  \n Synchrotron radiation is used in a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, and over 60 synchrotron radiation sources are operating around the world. New facilities are under construction, reflecting the growing demand in research and industrial applications.  \n I.10.6.1 Diffraction  \n Coherent diffraction on crystals has been used before the emergence of synchrotrons, at the time enabled by X-ray tubes. The renowned Photo 51, recorded by Rosalind Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling, found its way (through dubious ways) into the hands of James Watson and Francis Crick, who used it to decipher the double helix structure of DNA (see Fig. I.10.12).  \n Why do scientists use diffraction in place of imaging to determine the structure of molecules? Would it not be easier to simply magnify the X-ray image onto a detector, as we do in transmission electron microscopes?  \n The size of an atom is on the order of $1 \\ \\mathring { \\mathrm { A } } = 1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } \\ \\mathrm { m }$ , while the pixels of an X-ray detector are around $1 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ in size. A magnification of $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ would thus be required, and it turns out that no X-ray lens can provide this9. Unlike lenses for visible light, where glasses of different index of refraction and different dispersion can be combined to compensate lens errors, this is not possible for X-rays. Scientist use thus diffractive imaging, where a computer is used to reconstruct the distribution of atoms in the molecule from the diffraction pattern.  \n When a crystal is placed in a coherent X-ray beam, constructive interference occurs if the Bragg condition (Equation I.10.48) for the incoming and outgoing rays is fulfilled for any given crystal plane. The resulting diffraction pattern appears as a series of spots or fringes, commonly captured on a detector. As an example, the diffraction pattern of a complex biomolecule is shown in Fig. I.10.13. The crystal is then rotated to change the incoming angle, to allow for diffraction from other crystal planes to be recorded. Note that the detector records the number of photons, i.e., the intensity of the diffracted wave, but all phase information is lost.  \n One thus receives a series of two-dimensional diffraction patterns. The intensities of the diffracted spots relate to the absolute square of the Fourier transform of the electron density, and their positions correspond to the inverse of the spacing between planes of atoms in the crystal, as described by Bragg’s law.  \n However, directly computing the electron density from the diffraction pattern is not straightforward due to the phase problem: the detector records only the intensity of the diffracted waves, losing information about their phases. In essence, we only measure the amplitude of the Fourier transform, not its phase, yet both are necessary for accurate reconstruction. Various methods, such as using a known similar structure as a model (molecular replacement) or adding heavy atoms to the crystal (multiple isomorphous replacement), help in estimating these phases.  \n  \n Once the phases are estimated and combined with the intensities, the inverse Fourier transform is used to compute the electron density. The peaks in this electron density map correspond to the locations of the atoms in the crystal. By interpreting this map, scientists can determine the precise arrangement of atoms and thus the molecular structure of the sample. Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a powerful tool in various stages of structure determination from $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -ray crystallography data.  \n I.10.6.2 Spectroscopy  \n Spectroscopic methods are used for investigating the electronic structure, chemical composition, and dynamic properties of matter. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, including X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS), use the sudden change in absorption near edges (Section I.10.5.2) to probe the local atomic structure and electronic states of specific elements within a material (see Fig. I.10.14). Absorption edges, related to the ionization potential of inner-shell electrons in an atom, have a very small dependence on the chemical configuration of the atom in a molecule, as this shifts the energy levels slightly.  \n X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is based on the principle that when a material is irradiated with Xrays, electrons from the inner shells of the atoms in the material can be ejected, leading to the emission of fluorescence $\\mathrm { \\Delta X }$ -rays as electrons from higher energy levels fill these vacancies. The energy of the emitted fluorescence $\\mathrm { \\Delta } X$ -rays is characteristic of each element, thus enabling qualitative and quantitative analysis of the elemental composition of the sample (see Fig. I.10.15). Similarly, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measures the kinetic energy and the number of electrons that are emitted from the sample upon X-ray irradiation. Since the mean free path of free electrons in solids is only a few molecular layers, this technique enables the study of surface chemistry. Angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) allows reconstructing the momentum of the electrons in the solid, which is used to reconstruct the electronic band structure of the material.  \n  \n I.10.6.3 Tomographic imaging and ptychography  \n Tomography is a powerful imaging technique that reconstructs a three-dimensional object from its twodimensional projections. It is used widely in medicine, where it allows a detailed view of our skeleton. Synchrotron radiation sources, with their brilliant and monochromatic beams, allow reducing the exposure time to less than a millisecond while achieving micrometer resolution. This makes the technique useful for research in fields ranging from materials science to biology (see Fig. I.10.16).  \n The process involves rotating the sample through a range of angles relative to the X-ray beam, while collecting a series of two-dimensional absorption images. The three-dimensional distribution is reconstructed from the two-dimensional images.  \n  \n The monochromatic and coherent X-ray beams from a synchrotron allow recording phase contrast images, which can capture finer details of biological samples than the usual absorption contrast images.  \n In ptychography, a coherent X-ray beam is scanned across the sample in overlapping patterns, and the diffraction pattern from each area is recorded. These overlapping diffractions provide redundant information. The reconstruction algorithms used in ptychography are able to retrieve both the amplitude and phase information from the scattered wavefronts, leading to highly detailed images with nanometer resolution. Ptychography is particularly advantageous for studying materials with fine structural details and can be applied to a wide range of materials, including biological specimens, nanomaterials, and integrated electronic circuits (see e.g. https://youtu.be/GvyTiK9CNO0).  \n Synchrotron sources, with their intense and coherent X-ray beams, play a crucial role in both tomographic imaging and ptychography. They provide the necessary beam brightness and coherence, enabling the capture of high-resolution data and facilitating the reconstruction processes.  \n I.10.7 Collection of exercises  \n The subsequent section collects an assortment of problems discussed in tutorials, and used in the written exams at JUAS. Note that the exams were open-book exams, where personal notes and course material, as well as reference booklets were allowed.  \n You can find solutions to these exercises at https://ischebeck.net/juas/book/solutions. pdf  \n I.10.7.1 Energy and momentum  \n An electron is accelerated by a DC voltage of 1 MV.

Indeed, it was a supernova, and the remnants of this explosion, the Crab Nebula, are still visible today. It was discovered in the 1950’s that a significant portion of the light emitted by the Crab Nebula originates from synchrotron radiation (Fig. I.10.17).  \n Radiation is emitted by electrons with a wide energy spectrum.

        "text_data": "Observations and Diagnostics in High Brightness Beams  \n A. Cianchi University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy  \n Abstract  \n Brightness is a figure of merit largely used in light sources, such as freeelectron lasers, but it is also fundamental in several other applications, for instance, Compton back-scattering sources, beam-driven plasma accelerators and terahertz sources. Advanced diagnostics is mandatory for the development of high brightness beams. 6D electron-beam diagnostics will be reviewed, with emphasis on emittance measurement.  \n Keywords  \n Electron beam diagnostics; emittance.  \n 1 Introduction  \n Nowadays, a constant improvement of the characteristics of standard accelerators together with the development of new accelerators, techniques are opening completely new scenarios, paving the way to a complete revolution in the field of the accelerators.  \n The concept of electron-beam brightness was adopted from conventional optics, where beam brightness characterizes the quality of light sources. Electron-beam brightness is defined as current density per unit solid angle in the axial direction. While it is used for any kind of electron beam, from electron microscopes to free-electron lasers, it is very difficult to find a unique definition in the literature, especially because it is often confused with brilliance (see, for instance, Refs. [1], [2, p. 255], [3, p. 20], [4, p. 61], [5, p. 410], and [6, p. 73]). We follow the definition reported in Ref. [3]  \n $$\nB _ { n } = \\frac { 2 I } { \\pi ^ { 2 } \\varepsilon _ { n x } \\varepsilon _ { n y } }\n$$ \n where $I$ is the beam current, and $\\varepsilon _ { n x } , \\varepsilon _ { n y }$ are the transverse normalized emittance in the $x$ - and $y$ - directions, respectively. Brightness is measured in amps per square metre. Typical values of high brightness beams range between $1 0 ^ { 1 4 }$ and $1 0 ^ { 1 6 } \\ \\mathrm { A / m ^ { 2 } }$ . This definition is sometimes called 5D brightness; when this quantity is divided by the energy spread, it is called 6D brightness, see, for instance, Ref. [7]. Although brightness is a figure of merit largely used in light sources, like free-electron lasers, it is, however, fundamental in several other applications, for instance Compton back-scattering sources, beam-driven plasma accelerators, and terahertz sources.  \n It is difficult to define high brightness from the point of view of diagnostics. It is important to focus on how the brightness is determined. Since brightness is the ratio between current and emittance, high values can be obtained by increasing the current or reducing the emittance or by combining these effects in different proportions. In addition, the meaning of ‘brightness’ has changed during the years. The LCLS, an X-ray free-electron laser, was planned to use bunches with a charge of about $1 { \\mathrm { n C } }$ , but today operates with bunch charges of $2 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { p C }$ and sometimes as little as $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { p C }$ , while the beam still preserves high brightness. The charge reduction, keeping charge density constant, decreases the emittance, and permits shorter bunches with higher currents. Using a $1 ~ \\mathrm { n C }$ beam with a $1 { - } 2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ -mrad normalized emittance means that conventional intercepting diagnostics can be difficult, especially if the beam is tightly focused. The beam can deposit enough energy on the device to destroy or severely damage it.  \n However, reducing the charge and squeezing the bunch down to 100 fs or even shorter opens new problems in the resolution of longitudinal diagnostics. So high brightness diagnostics covers a wide  \n A. CIANCHI  \n range of very different scenarios. In recent years, the growing interest for acceleration schemes based on plasma acceleration has even increased this range. In fact, in some of the proposed schemes there are two beams to be characterized at the same time: the beam injected into the plasma (in the case of external injection, the input beam) and the one leaving the plasma (the output beam, present in all of the schemes for diagnostics of self- [8] and external injection [9]).  \n 2 Measuring beam size  \n Measurement of the beam dimensions is fundamental, to retrieve the value of the transverse emittance and to check proper beam matching through the machine. We are focusing here on high brightness machines, mainly linacs. Being single-passage devices they allow the use of intercepting diagnostics. Later, we will discuss the limits of using intercepting devices, but for most applications they are adequate.  \n A beam does not have a sharp edge, so it is quite difficult to define a clear boundary. To overcome this problem, the r.m.s. (root mean square) dimension is usually adopted. Let us assume a 1D intensity distribution, which can represent the projection of the beam profile on one axis, with $i$ points each of intensity $I _ { i }$ . The definition of the second momentum of the distribution is  \n $$\n\\left. x ^ { 2 } \\right. = \\frac { \\displaystyle \\sum _ { i } I _ { i } \\left( x _ { i } - \\bar { x } \\right) ^ { 2 } } { \\displaystyle \\sum _ { i } I _ { i } } .\n$$ \n Be aware that a point with $x = { \\bar { x } }$ gives no contribution, even if its intensity is very large, while a point very far away from $\\bar { x }$ gives a huge contribution, even for a small intensity. In Ref. [10], the reader can find several approaches to data processing in order to discriminate the beam from the surrounding halo.  \n We consider here only three types of monitor. A more exhaustive review of monitors for transverse profiles can be found in Ref. [11]. A metallic foil, or often a silicon aluminized wafer, placed at $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ with respect to the beam direction, is used as source of OTR (optical transition radiation), see Fig. 1.  \n The transition radiation is produced when a charge passes through the interface between two media with different refractive indices and is emitted in a narrow cone, with an angle of about $1 / \\gamma$ , making this diagnostics unsuitable for low energy beams (less than tens of megaelectronvolts for electrons, for instance) where the radiation emission angle is too large to be efficiently collected by imaging optics. Also the intensity of the radiation is weak, with an efficiency of conversion between electrons and photons between $1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ and $1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ in the visible wavelengths. However, the prompt and linear emission, mainly arising because it is a surface effect, makes this device the best choice for longitudinal and transverse measurements, with high energy and bunch charges higher than several tens of picocoulombs.  \n It is worth mentioning that OTR diagnostics might fail even for high-energy electron beams, owing to coherence effects in the emission process (coherent transition radiation (COTR); see, for instance. Ref. [12]), i.e., when the bunch length (even locally, owing to some microbunching) is of the order of the observed wavelength, or shorter than it.  \n Inorganic scintillators are widely used, owing to their large photon yield, even for low charges, and their high threshold radiation damage. Reference [13] provides an extensive review of their principal characteristics. While the resolution of the OTR monitor is mainly dominated by the radiation collection optics [14], in this case, the material itself presents a structure with grains that limits its value to the order of a few micrometres. Moreover this kind of radiator is transparent to its own radiation, resulting in an unwanted blurring effect that leads to an overestimation of the beam size (Fig. 2).  \n For this reason, the scintillators must be as thin as possible, of the order of $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ or even less. They can be used for beams of all energies, even with low charge. However, they experience saturation problems at high charges and their resolution is limited to the crystal grain size. Even scintillators can have trouble with COTR emission. It has only recently become possible to overcome this problem, using a new geometry [15] and playing with the difference between the isotropic emission of the crystal and the directional emission of the COTR.  \n Both OTR and scintillator screens are easy to implement and offer a 2D map of the charge distribution in a single shot. They are often called view screens. However, being intercepting devices, they scatter the beam all around, causing some problems, especially when high radiation levels are dangerous for the surrounding equipment. Also high-power density beams can seriously damage them, depositing too much energy.  \n To overcome these problems, a wire scanner is the popular solution. It is used in both circular and linear machines. It is basically a floating wire, moving transversally with respect to the beam orbit. When the beam hits the wire, a surrounding system of photomultiplier tubes detects a signal coming from the bremsstrahlung inside the wire material. By moving the wire scanner step by step, and recording signals in the photomultiplier tube, it is possible to correlate the beam intensity for every different spatial position of the wire. The wire enables the beam transverse size to be measured in the direction orthogonal to the wire itself, so the measurement is 1D and in multi-shots.  \n The main concerns in the design of wire scanners are mechanical stability of the mover and possible damage to the wire, see for instance, Ref. [16].  \n 3 Emittance  \n The main parameter to be measured is the emittance.  \n Figure 3 shows two trace space diagrams. Remember that phase space diagrams have momentum on the $y$ -axis, while the trace space diagram has the transverse angle. The area in the phase space is the Liouville invariant emittance, while the area in the trace space is just the geometrical emittance. This is the quantity that we measure. Because the beams do not have sharp edges and are very diffuse, the r.m.s.  \n A. CIANCHI  \n emittance is used [17]. In both plots of Fig. 3 the area is zero, while the r.m.s. emittance is not always zero. The square of geometrical emittance is defined as  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { r m s } } ^ { 2 } = \\left. x ^ { 2 } \\right. \\left. x ^ { \\prime 2 } \\right. - \\left. x x ^ { \\prime } \\right. ^ { 2 } ,\n$$ \n and assuming a general correlation between $x$ and $x ^ { \\prime }$ such as $x = C x ^ { \\prime n }$ , where $C$ is a constant, the geometrical emittance can be rewritten as  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { r m s } } ^ { 2 } = C \\left. x ^ { 2 } \\right. \\left. x ^ { 2 n } \\right. - \\left. x ^ { n + 1 } \\right. ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n It is clear that if $n = 1$ , even the r.m.s. emittance is zero, while this is not true for $n > 1$ . So the r.m.s. emittance is more a figure of merit of the beam quality than the area of the trace space. For pure monochromatic beams, the normalized emittance is just $\\beta \\gamma$ times the geometrical emittance, where $\\gamma$ is the relativistic factor and $\\beta$ is the ratio between the particle speed and the speed of the light. Otherwise (see, for instance, Refs. [18] and [19]), there is also a contribution from the energy spread and the beam divergence. In fact, the Liouville invariant is the normalized emittance, defined as  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { n } } ^ { 2 } = \\left. x ^ { 2 } \\right. \\left. \\beta ^ { 2 } \\gamma ^ { 2 } x ^ { \\prime 2 } \\right. - \\left. x \\beta \\gamma x ^ { \\prime } \\right. .\n$$ \n It has been demonstrated in Ref. [19] that this formula can be rewritten as  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { n } } ^ { 2 } = \\left. \\gamma \\right. ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { \\varepsilon } ^ { 2 } \\left. x ^ { 2 } \\right. \\left. x ^ { \\prime 2 } \\right. + \\left. \\beta \\gamma \\right. ^ { 2 } \\left( \\left. x ^ { 2 } \\right. \\left. x ^ { \\prime 2 } \\right. - \\left. x x ^ { \\prime } \\right. ^ { 2 } \\right) ,\n$$ \n where $\\sigma _ { \\varepsilon }$ is the relative energy spread and the second term is the geometrical emittance multiplied by $\\beta \\gamma$ . The first term is usually negligible in conventional accelerators, but it could be the leading one in some scenarios, such as in plasma-based accelerators. In such a case, both energy spread and angular divergence are needed, to measure the normalized emittance.  \n 3.1 Emittance measurement with space charge  \n The envelope equation [4] in a drift space is  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { x } ^ { \\prime \\prime } = \\frac { \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { n } } ^ { 2 } } { \\gamma ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { x } ^ { 3 } } + \\frac { I } { \\gamma ^ { 3 } I _ { 0 } \\left( \\sigma _ { x } + \\sigma _ { y } \\right) } \\ : ,\n$$ \n where $\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { { n } } }$ is the normalized emittance, $\\sigma _ { x }$ and $\\sigma _ { y }$ are the beam dimensions, $I$ is the beam current and $I _ { 0 }$ is the Alfvén current. When the term representing the space charge, the second term in this equation, is greater than the emittance term, the dynamic regime is said to be space charge dominated. Because the space charge contribution decreases as $\\gamma ^ { 2 }$ , this term is relevant only at low energies. However, as it arises from an internal pressure inside the beam, this term must be kept negligible to measure the emittance.  \n The most common technique is called the pepperpot technique. The principle is shown in Fig. 4. The beam is stopped or heavily scattered by a mask of a material of high atomic number, usually tungsten, while some parts of the beam, called beamlets, pass through small holes or apertures. Since the charge is significantly suppressed, the beamlets are emittance dominated. After a proper drift, a scintillator screen produces an image of the beamlets. The relative intensity of each beamlet image is a direct measurement of the transverse beam distribution, $\\left. x ^ { 2 } \\right.$ . In fact, it is a measurement of how much charge is entering any single hole; if the mask geometry is well known, it is a sampling of the beam transverse charge distribution. The width of each single spot gives a measurement of the beam divergence $\\left. { x ^ { \\prime } { } ^ { 2 } } \\right.$ . A perfectly parallel beam produces images with dimensions equal to the hole size. The increase of this dimension is only due to the beam angular divergence, if the space charge contribution is negligible. Finally the mapping of the angular spread in different transverse positions allows the reconstruction of the correlation term between position and divergence, $\\langle x x ^ { \\prime } \\rangle$ . In this way, we can measure the second term in Eq. (6), i.e., the geometrical emittance.  \n  \n In implementing this diagnostic technique, there are some constrains to keep in mind. First of all, the hole dimensions must be large enough to allow some beam to pass through, to improve the signal-tonoise ratio, but at the same time they must ensure that the beamlets are emittance and not space charge dominated. The ratio between the two terms in the envelope equation is  \n $$\nR _ { 0 } = \\frac { I \\sigma _ { x } ^ { 2 } } { 2 \\gamma I _ { 0 } \\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { n } } ^ { 2 } } .\n$$ \n Assuming a uniform beam charge distribution in the holes, the r.m.s. is $\\sigma _ { x } = d / \\sqrt { 1 2 }$ , where $d$ is the diameter of the hole. To ensure that the beamlets are emittance dominated, $R _ { 0 } \\ll 1$ . This constrains the value of $d$ . In photoinjectors, the value of $d$ is usually about $5 0 - 1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n The length $L$ of the drift between the mask and the screen is another important parameter, in order to give to the beamlets enough space to develop a dimension greater than the hole size. The beam size at a distance $L$ from the mask is  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { x } = \\sqrt { \\left( L \\cdot \\sigma _ { x } ^ { \\prime } \\right) ^ { 2 } + \\frac { d ^ { 2 } } { 1 2 } } .\n$$ \n Since $\\sigma _ { x } ^ { \\prime }$ is the parameter to measure, the first term in the square root must be much greater than the second one, setting the limit of the shorter acceptable drift $L$ . In addition, the thickness $l$ of the mask material is very important. It must be large enough to stop or heavily scatter the beam at a large angle (a critical issue at high energies), but a large thickness can limit the angular acceptance of the hole, which cannot be smaller than the expected angular divergence of the beam, i.e., $l \\ll d / 2 \\sigma _ { x } ^ { \\prime }$ .  \n It is worth mentioning that this technique not only enables the emittance and the Twiss parameters to be measured but can also be used to reconstruct the entire trace space. The holes are the sampling of the properties of such a space in different transverse positions. Figure 5 shows a comparison between simulated and measured trace spaces [20], demonstrating the effectiveness of this system.  \n A. CIANCHI  \n 3.1.1 Limits of this technique  \n Since the pepperpot technique is a sampling of the trace space, it can be affected by undersampling.   \nConsider Fig. 6, in which two different trace spaces are compared [21].  \n The pepperpot measurement is a single-shot measurement and so is quite appealing from plasmaaccelerated beams, where shot-to-shot instabilities makes a multi-shot technique unfeasible. However, the highly correlated trace space, proper to such beam types, severely affects the measurement resolution. The sampling error in the geometrical emittance has been established [22] is  \n $$\n\\varepsilon _ { \\mathrm { e r r } } = \\frac { 2 } { \\pi } \\left( x _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } \\Delta x ^ { \\prime } + x _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ^ { \\prime } \\Delta x \\right) ,\n$$ \n where $x _ { \\mathrm { m a x } }$ is the beam size, $x _ { \\mathrm { m a x } } ^ { \\prime }$ is the maximum angular spread, $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta x ^ { \\prime }$ are the sampling intervals in position and angle. While in a conventional accelerated beam, as the energy increases, adiabatic damping decreases the values of the $x$ and $x ^ { \\prime }$ , in a plasma-accelerated beam a significant angular spread could be present, even at high energy. In such a case, this error is larger than the measured emittance.  \n 3.2 Emittance measurement without space charge  \n It has been demonstrated [23], both theoretically and experimentally, that when the space charge regime dominates, the pepperpot technique is the only method that can reliably measure the emittance. However, if the emittance term is the leading one in Eq. (7), another approach is followed.  \n The quadrupole scan [24] is the most used technique for measuring the emittance in such a regime. It relies on the measurement of the beam spot varying the strength of one or more quadrupoles. It is intrinsically a multi-shot measurement and, because it involves the use of magnetic elements, a large energy spread can spoil the emittance value [25]. There is an extensive treatment of this point in Ref. [26].  \n Here, we want to focus on the main concepts. Consider two points in the transverse space, in different longitudinal positions along the machine, $x$ and $x _ { 0 }$ , with their relative transverse momenta, $x ^ { \\prime }$ and $\\boldsymbol { x ^ { \\prime } } _ { 0 }$ . The Courant–Snyder invariant must be the same in the two positions.  \n $$\n\\gamma x ^ { 2 } + 2 \\alpha x x ^ { \\prime } + \\beta x ^ { \\prime 2 } = \\varepsilon = \\gamma _ { 0 } x _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } + 2 \\alpha _ { 0 } x _ { 0 } x _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } + \\beta _ { 0 } x _ { 0 } ^ { ' 2 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\alpha , \\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are the Twiss parameters in $x$ and $\\alpha _ { 0 } , \\beta _ { 0 }$ and $\\gamma _ { 0 }$ in $x _ { 0 }$ and $M$ is a transport matrix between the two positions $x$ and $x _ { 0 }$ with the following elements:  \n $$\nM \\left( x , x _ { 0 } \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array} { c c } { { C } } & { { S } } \\\\ { { C ^ { \\prime } } } & { { S ^ { \\prime } } } \\end{array} \\right) .\n$$ \n It has been demonstrated [27] that, using Eq. (12) in Eq. (11), the transport matrix for the Twiss parameters is  \n $$\n\\left( \\begin{array} { c } { { \\beta } } \\\\ { { \\alpha } } \\\\ { { \\gamma } } \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array} { c c c } { { C ^ { 2 } } } & { { - 2 S C } } & { { S ^ { 2 } } } \\\\ { { - C C ^ { \\prime } } } & { { S ^ { \\prime } C + S C ^ { \\prime } } } & { { - S S ^ { \\prime } } } \\\\ { { C ^ { \\prime 2 } } } & { { - 2 S ^ { \\prime } C ^ { \\prime } } } & { { S ^ { \\prime 2 } } } \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array} { c } { { \\beta _ { 0 } } } \\\\ { { \\alpha _ { 0 } } } \\\\ { { \\gamma _ { 0 } } } \\end{array} \\right) \\ .\n$$ \n Let us define a so-called $\\sigma$ matrix:  \n $$\n\\sigma = \\left( \\begin{array} { c c } { { \\sigma _ { 1 1 } } } & { { \\sigma _ { 1 2 } } } \\\\ { { \\sigma _ { 2 1 } } } & { { \\sigma _ { 2 2 } } } \\end{array} \\right) = \\varepsilon \\left( \\begin{array} { c c } { { \\beta } } & { { - \\alpha } } \\\\ { { - \\alpha } } & { { \\gamma } } \\end{array} \\right) .\n$$ \n Knowledge of the elements of this matrix allows a complete definition of the beam trace space. We focus on the $\\sigma _ { 1 1 }$ element. It is equal to $\\varepsilon \\beta$ . From Fig. 7 it is clear that it is just the square of the projection of the trace ellipse on the transverse axis. So this is a measurable quantity, being the beam size dimension, which can be retrieved using a view screen.  \n It is possible to demonstrate that the Courant–Snyder invariant in Eq. (11) can be rewritten as  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { 1 1 } x ^ { 2 } + 2 \\sigma _ { 1 2 } x x ^ { \\prime } + \\sigma _ { 2 2 } x ^ { \\prime 2 } = 1 .\n$$ \n Using Eq. (13), the transformation for the sigma matrix between $x$ and $x _ { 0 }$ can be written as  \n $$\n\\boldsymbol { \\sigma } _ { 1 } = \\boldsymbol { M } \\boldsymbol { \\sigma } _ { 0 } \\boldsymbol { M } ^ { \\mathrm { T } } .\n$$ \n Following this transformation, the first element of the sigma matrix in the $x$ position, i.e., $\\sigma _ { 1 1 } ^ { 1 }$ , can be expanded as  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { 1 1 } ^ { 1 } = C ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { 1 1 } ^ { 0 } + 2 S C \\sigma _ { 1 2 } ^ { 0 } + S ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { 2 2 } ^ { 0 } .\n$$ \n A. CIANCHI  \n The square of the beam size is a linear combination of several elements, some of them well known, like the elements of the transport matrix $C$ and $S$ , and others unknown, as $\\sigma _ { 1 1 } ^ { 0 } , \\sigma _ { 1 2 } ^ { 0 }$ and $\\sigma _ { 2 2 } ^ { 0 }$ , i.e., the elements of the beam matrix at the position where we want to know the beam trace space.  \n Three measurements in three different positions are sufficient to determine the unknown quantities, or alternatively at least three measurements changing the values of the beam transport matrix are needed, for instance, varying the field of a quadrupole to change the values of the elements of the transport matrix.  \n While there are examples of measurements in different positions (sometimes called multiscreen methods) and the reader can find interesting details about this technique in Ref. [28], the quadrupole scan method is widely used.  \n Between theory and practice, there is always a gap. In this scheme, sometimes the use of more than one quadrupole, to avoid strong defocalization of the beam in one plane, is necessary. However, it must be remembered that the more chromatic elements are used, the larger the effect on the emittance dilution will be [25]. The main error comes from the determination of the beam size [10]. The reader can find an excellent paper about the experimental uncertainties in such a measurement in Ref. [29].  \n While the pepperpot technique gives not only an emittance measurement but also a picture of the trace space, it is not the same for a quadrupole scan. To reconstruct the full trace space, more sophisticated strategies must be applied. The most common is tomography reconstruction, based on the reconstruction of an $n$ -dimensional object starting from its $( n - 1 ) \\mathbf { t }$ h dimensional projections. Several quadrupoles are needed to have a complete rotation of the trace space, so a dedicated beamline must be designed for such a task. This is why this system is rarely used. More details can be found in Ref. [30].  \n 3.3 Non-intercepting diagnostics  \n The intercepting nature of this measurement could be a problem in the case of high repetition rate machines, or high charge beams, or if a shot-to-shot correlation between input and output beams in plasma wakefield accelerators is needed. Non-intercepting beam size measurements are not yet state of the art. Here, we report briefly three examples of promising techniques: laser wire, beam position monitor and diffraction radiation.  \n The laser wire [31] is a non-intercepting version of the wire scanner. Basically a tiny but intense laser wire is moved with respect to a beam, as shown in Fig. 8.  \n The Compton-scattered photons produced in the overlap between the laser wire and the electron beam, are collected by scintillators surrounding the vacuum chamber. Some tests are still ongoing but it a resolution in the submicrometre scale has already been demonstrated [32]. The main drawback of this technique is the intrinsic multi-shot nature and the stability of the laser wire alignment. Often, the whole chamber hosting the laser cavity is moved in front of the beam.  \n It is possible to extract much more than the position of the beam from the signal emerging from a beam position monitor. It has been demonstrated that, by using a combination of signals coming from the different electrodes, it is also possible to retrieve the beam size [33]. A nice follow-up [34] demonstrated that this system is really interesting in circular machines, where there is a high repetition rate. Furthermore, Ref. [35] presents a refinement of this method, in which a beam position monitor is moved with a stepper motor at the micrometre scale. A recent paper [36] claimed that beam emittance could be measured using such a method. However, because the signal-to-noise ratio is very small, both the electromagnetic design of the electrodes and the mathematical treatment of the signal are fundamental.  \n When a charged particle passes through an aperture on a boundary between two media with different refraction indices, diffraction radiation is emitted in both the forward and backward directions. The diffraction radiation is emitted only when the dimension of the transverse electromagnetic field, at a given wavelength and beam energy, is larger than the aperture size. Since the beam passes through a hole, diffraction radiation provides a non-intercepting diagnostics tool, and is therefore well suited for measuring parameters of high charge density beams in a parasitic way.  \n The use of the angular distribution of the diffraction radiation as beam size monitor from a rectangular aperture was introduced in Ref. [37], while other authors have proposed a similar technique by using a circular aperture [38]. The choice of a rectangular slit shape has many advantages, e.g., mechanical machining and mathematical treatment, that were at the basis of the success of the first observation of diffraction radiation [39] as a diagnostics tool.  \n However, this result has also indicated some difficulties related to the experimental set-up; in particular, the low signal-to-noise ratio, mainly affected by the unavoidable synchrotron radiation background produced by the same beam in the upstream magnetic elements of the transport line and the requirement of an accurate and non-trivial control of the beam trajectory, owing to the ambiguity produced by a beam passing off-centre of the aperture.  \n The use of optical diffraction radiation interference (ODRI) [40], i.e. a two-slit system placed well inside the formation length (Fig. 9), can solve both of these problems; this technique was successfully used to measure the beam emittance [41].  \n 4 Longitudinal parameters  \n Longitudinal measurements for high brightness beams are more established than transverse ones, except for the single-shot spectroscopic technique, as explained in the following. The main challenge of longitudinal diagnostics of high brightness beam is time resolution. Nowadays, we work with bunch lengths shorter than 100 fs, down to a few femtoseconds.  \n 4.1 Transverse deflecting structure  \n Transverse deflecting structures [42,43], sometimes also called RF deflectors, are powerful devices, able to attain resolutions of even a few femtoseconds in the X-ray band [44]. They are single-shot intercepting devices (for the measurement, but they need to be calibrated in multi-shot scenarios, as we’ll see later), with the advantages of an inherent self-calibrating nature, simple implementation, and usage.  \n The working principle is shown in Fig. 10. A time-dependent transverse deflecting voltage is present in a standing or traveling wave structure. Different parts of the beam, in different longitudinal positions, explore a correlated force that imprints a transverse momentum on the bunch. After a drift, the imaging on a screen returns the longitudinal charge distribution. The change in the transverse momentum is $\\Delta y ^ { \\prime } = q V / p c$ , where $V$ is the deflecting voltage, $q$ is the charge, $p$ is the momentum, and $c$ is the speed of light. Assuming that the deflecting voltage is of the form $V = V _ { 0 } \\sin ( k z + \\varphi )$ , where $k = 2 \\pi / \\lambda$ and $\\lambda$ is the RF wavelength, and considering that the bunch length is usually much smaller than such a wavelength (i.e., $k z \\ll 1 \\AA$ ), it is possible to expand the expression  \n $$\n\\sin ( k z + \\varphi ) = \\sin ( k z ) \\cos ( \\varphi ) + \\cos ( k z ) \\sin ( \\varphi ) \\simeq k z \\cos ( \\varphi ) + \\sin ( \\varphi ) ~ .\n$$ \n The expression of the change in the transverse momentum given by the structure is  \n $$\n\\Delta y ^ { \\prime } = { \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } } \\left[ k z \\cos ( \\varphi ) + \\sin ( \\varphi ) \\right] .\n$$ \n Using a phase value like $\\varphi = 0$ or $\\varphi = \\pi$ nulls the second term, and the kick has a simple proportionality to the longitudinal position of the charge. Using a general expression of the transport matrix in terms of the Twiss parameter (see Ref. [45]) the value of the vertical displacement as a function of the longitudinal position is  \n $$\ny ( z ) = y _ { 0 } + \\left( \\sqrt { \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } } \\sin { \\Delta } \\right) y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } \\pm \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } k z \\left( \\sqrt { \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } } \\sin { \\Delta } \\right)\n$$ \n where $\\beta _ { 0 }$ and $\\beta$ are the Twiss parameters on the RF deflector and on the screen, respectively, $\\mathsf { y } _ { 0 }$ is the displacement of the charge with respect the axis of the cavity, and $\\Delta$ is the betatron phase advance between the RF deflector and the screen. The $\\pm$ sign depends on which zero of the RF phase is chosen, $\\sin ( \\varphi ) = 0$ for both $\\varphi = 0$ or $\\varphi = \\pi$ . The second momentum of the distribution on the screen is given  \n by  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { r l } & { \\left. \\left( y - \\langle y \\rangle \\right) ^ { 2 } \\right. ^ { \\perp } = \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \\right. + \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\Delta \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime 2 } \\right. - \\left. y _ { 0 } \\right. ^ { 2 } + \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\Delta \\left( \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } k \\right) ^ { 2 } \\left. z ^ { 2 } \\right. + } \\\\ & { - \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\Delta \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } \\right. ^ { 2 } - \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } \\left( \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } k \\right) ^ { 2 } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\Delta \\left. z \\right. ^ { 2 } + } \\\\ & { + 2 \\sqrt { \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } } \\sin \\Delta \\left. y _ { 0 } y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } \\right. \\pm 2 \\sqrt { \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } } \\sin \\Delta \\left( \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } k \\right) \\left. y _ { 0 } z \\right. - 2 \\sqrt { \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } } \\sin \\Delta \\left. y _ { 0 } \\right. \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } \\right. + } \\\\ & { \\mp 2 \\sqrt { \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } } \\sin \\Delta \\left( \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } k \\right) \\left. y _ { 0 } \\right. \\left. z \\right. \\pm 2 \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\Delta \\left( \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } k \\right) \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } z \\right. + } \\\\ & { \\mp 2 \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\Delta \\left( \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } k \\right) \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } \\right. \\left. z \\right. } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Usually $\\left. y _ { 0 } \\right. = \\left. z \\right. = \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } \\right. = 0$ .  \n When there is no power in the RFD, and using the former condition, we get  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } = \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } \\right. + \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\Delta \\left. y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime 2 } \\right. + 2 \\sqrt { \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } } \\sin \\Delta \\left. y _ { 0 } y _ { 0 } ^ { \\prime } \\right.\n$$ \n It represents the dimension of the beam on the screen without any power in the RFD.  \n Several terms appear in 20 with different sign for a different choice of the phase $\\varphi$ . An average of the measurements of the second momentum with the two opposite phases $\\scriptstyle { \\varphi = 0 }$ and $\\scriptstyle { \\varphi = \\pi }$ is required in order to cancel them. Finally the dimension measured is  \n $$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt { \\sigma _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } + \\sigma _ { z } ^ { 2 } }\n$$ \n where $\\begin{array} { r } { \\sigma _ { z } ^ { 2 } = \\beta \\beta _ { 0 } \\sin ^ { 2 } \\Delta \\left( \\frac { q V _ { 0 } } { p c } k \\right) ^ { 2 } \\left. z ^ { 2 } \\right. } \\end{array}$  \n To increase the resolution of the device the term $\\sigma _ { 0 } ^ { 2 }$ must be much smaller than $\\sigma _ { z } ^ { 2 }$ , so the spot on the screen with RFD off must be the smallest achievable. Looking at formula Eq. (19), we can see that other ways to improve the resolution are to increase the deflecting voltage (it is the value of the integrated voltage along the structure so, to some extent, increasing the device length can also work) or to decrease the RF wavelength.  \n One of the most interesting features of the RF deflector is its inherent self-calibrating nature. Basically, simply changing the phase by a precise amount and recording the variation in the centre-ofmass position on a view screen gives the conversion scale between pixels and phase, and thus also time.  \n The use of a dipole (i.e., a energy dispersive element) together with the RF deflector (i.e., a timedispersive element) allows measurement of the longitudinal trace space in a single shot (Fig. 11).  \n A. CIANCHI  \n However, owing to the Panofsky–Wenzel theorem [46] the RF deflector introduces an energy spread that must be evaluated, to understand whether it is comparable or not with the slice energy spread [47].  \n 4.2 Coherent radiation based measurement  \n A bunch charge can emit coherent radiation at a wavelength longer than its length. The characteristics of this radiation depend on the physical phenomena involved, such as synchrotron radiation, transition radiation, Smith–Purcell, and so on. Consider an electron bunch whose centre of mass is the origin of a coordinate system $G$ , see Fig. 12.  \n Let us write $R$ as the distance from the source to the detector and $\\hat { n } _ { j }$ the unit vector that selects the observation direction for the $j$ th particle, $\\vec { r }$ being the position vector of the $j$ th electron relative to its bunch centre. We can express the electric field generated by the $j$ th electron as  \n $$\nE _ { j } = \\mathrm { e } ^ { \\mathrm { i } \\frac { 2 \\pi } { \\lambda } ( c t - { \\hat { n } } _ { i } \\cdot { \\vec { r } } _ { j } ) } .\n$$ \n If the distance from the source to the detector is much larger than the extent of the bunch $\\sigma _ { z }$ , i.e., $R \\gg \\sigma _ { z }$ , the total field is given by the sum of the fields of each of the $N$ particles and the total intensity can be written, in the limit of the Fraunhofer scalar theory, as  \n $$\nI _ { \\mathrm { t o t } } \\left( \\omega \\right) = I _ { \\mathrm { s p } } \\left( \\omega \\right) \\sum _ { j , k } E _ { j } E _ { k } ^ { * } ,\n$$ \n where $I _ { \\mathrm { s p } } ( \\omega )$ is the spectrum produced by a single particle. The analysis of the spectrum of such radiation can reveal the bunch longitudinal structure. Expanding the former equation, the spectrum intensity is given by  \n $$\nI _ { \\mathrm { t o t } } \\left( \\omega \\right) = I _ { \\mathrm { s p } } \\left( \\omega \\right) \\left[ N + N \\left( N - 1 \\right) F \\left( \\omega \\right) \\right] ,\n$$ \n where $I _ { \\mathrm { s p } } ( \\omega )$ is the spectrum produced by a single particle, $N$ is the number of particles and $F ( \\omega )$ is the so-called form factor. The physics of the emitting process is contained inside $I _ { \\mathrm { s p } } ( \\omega )$ , while the information about the bunch is in $F ( \\omega )$ . The first term in the square bracket corresponds to incoherent emission and scales as the number of the particles, while the second term scales as $N ^ { 2 }$ and comes from the coherent emission. The form factor can be expressed as a function of the charge distribution $\\rho ( z )$ , as  \n $$\nF \\left( \\omega \\right) = \\left. \\int _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } \\rho \\left( z \\right) \\mathrm { e } ^ { \\mathrm { i } \\frac { \\omega } { c } z } \\mathrm { d } z \\right. ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n The inverse transformation gives the searched value of $\\rho \\left( z \\right)$  \n $$\n\\rho \\left( z \\right) = \\frac { 1 } { \\pi c } \\intop _ { 0 } ^ { \\infty } \\sqrt { F \\left( \\omega \\right) } \\cos \\left( \\frac { \\omega } { c } z \\right) .\n$$ \n Being an even transformation, the odd terms in the longitudinal distribution are not considered and a phase reconstruction technique must be used to retrieve phase information [48]. So the information about the longitudinal parameter is inside the form factor, which can be obtained from the power spectrum. The principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy [49, 50] were discovered by Michelson and Rayleigh, who identified that the interference pattern from a two-beam interferometer, obtained by altering the path difference between the two beams, is the Fourier transform of the radiation passing through the interferometer,  \n $$\nI \\left( \\omega \\right) \\propto \\intop _ { - \\infty } ^ { \\infty } I \\left( \\delta \\right) \\cos \\left( \\frac { \\omega \\delta } { c } \\right) \\mathrm { d } \\delta ,\n$$ \n where $\\delta$ is the path length difference between the two interferometer arms: $I ( \\delta )$ is called the interferogram. So to estimate the bunch length we need to measure the spectrum of the coherent radiation, and to do this we have to record the intensity of the radiation on a detector in an interferometer, varying the path difference between two arms of this device. Since the bunch lengths for high brightness beams are of the order of picoseconds or even shorter, the coherent radiation is usually in the terahertz frequency range. For such frequencies, the most used detectors are thermal detectors, like Golay cells and pyroelectric detectors.  \n A Golay cell [51] is a thermo-acoustic detector consisting of a small cell filled with a gas, typically xenon because of its low thermal conductivity, and a sensitive heat-absorbing film with low thermal capacity, which ensures a flat response to different frequencies. The frequency dependence is given, in principle, only by the properties of the window material used.  \n Radiation goes through the window and is absorbed by the film, warming it and the contained gas up. The gas therefore expands and the resulting pressure change modifies the shape of a flexible aluminized membrane at the back of the cell, which acts as a mirror. To convert the membrane movement into an electrical signal, a light-emitting diode illuminates the back of the flexible mirror. The reflected light is then focused onto a photocell.  \n Pyroelectric detectors produce a signal in response to a change in their temperature. Below a temperature $T _ { \\mathrm { c } }$ , known as the Curie point, ferroelectric materials (triglycine sulfate, lithium, tantalate) exhibit a large spontaneous electrical polarization. If the temperature is altered by an incident radiation, the polarization changes; if electrodes are placed on opposite faces of a thin dielectric, forming a capacitor, the change in polarization can be observed as an electrical signal. The process is independent of the wavelength of the incident radiation, resulting in a flat response over a wide spectral range.  \n The main advantages of Golay cells are high sensitivity and wide bandwidth in the millimetre range, while the main drawback is the slow temporal response (decay time of the order of tens of milliseconds). However, pyroelectric detectors, even exhibiting less sensitivity, have a faster response time; they are more robust and reliable than Golay cells and they are more widely used.  \n One of the main issues in this kind of measurement is the precise reconstruction of the entire spectrum, as there is a low frequency cut-off, owing to the vacuum pipe, the interferometer components and the detector acceptance. The overall transfer function of the whole system must be known, including the transfer function of the vacuum window and the transport line.  \n For all these reasons, a practical approach to these measurement is not to make the inverse Fourier transform the experimental data, but to fit the spectrum directly to guessed and well known distributions [52].  \n Longitudinal diagnostics with this technique began about 20 years ago and are is now widespread, but they have the big disadvantage of being multi-shot methods. However, some groups already performed single-shot measurements. In Ref. [53], Wesch et al. used a multi-stage spectrometer with a series of blazed reflection gratings. In any stage, wavelengths shorter than a threshold are dispersed while the longer wavelengths are reflected. With every grating focused on an array of detectors, it is  \n A. CIANCHI  \n possible to acquire in a single shot the whole spectrum for terahertz and infrared spectroscopy. The main challenge of such a device is the alignment of the various stages. To overcome this problem, in [54] Maxwell et al. used a single-stage single-shot device, based on a KRS-5 (thallium bromoiodide) prism. This material is quite interesting, even if it is hygroscopic, because it has a quite flat response between 0.8 and $4 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The radiation is dispersed and then sent to 128 lead zirconate titanate pyroelectric elements with $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ spacing line array.  \n The major advantage of these techniques based on the coherent radiation is the time resolution. The emitted wavelength scales as the bunch length. So the only requirement is a device sensitive to such wavelengths. For instance, 1 ps means $3 0 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ , while 1 fs needs a wavelength sensitivity of $3 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ , where a lot of detectors are available.  \n 4.3 Electro-optic sampling  \n The electro-optic diagnostics technique is a non-destructive and single-shot method.  \n Large electric fields (of the order of megavolts per metre) applied to optically active crystals lead to the linear electro-optic effect (the Pockels effect), which is the basis of electro-optic detection techniques. In an isotropic medium, the polarization induced by an electric field is always parallel and linear with the electric field vector and related to the field by a scalar factor, the susceptibility. If the medium is anisotropic, the induced polarization is still linear but not necessarily parallel to the electric field, so the susceptibility is a tensor. In such a case, the crystal becomes birefringent, with different refraction indices along its principal axes.  \n The Coulomb electric field co-propagating with the relativistic electron bunch induces a timedependent birefringence in an optically active crystal. A near infrared laser propagates along the crystal. Figure 13 shows the so-called ellipse index.  \n Without any external applied field, the crystal is isotropic and the refraction indices are equal along both axes. However, when the field is applied, the ellipse is distorted and the indices are different. The polarization of the external laser is in between these axes. Owing to the different refraction indices, the propagation speeds along these different axes are different, and this results in a rotation in the laser polarization. If we place an orthogonal polarizer before the crystal and another after it, we can observe the laser transmission only when there is an applied electric field. So the rotation angle encodes information about the field strength, which reflects the amount of the charge in the beam bunch that produces such a field.  \n There are mainly three schemes to obtain this information. The first is called spectral decoding [55].  \n As shown in Fig. 14, a femtosecond laser pulse is stretched in a picosecond long stretcher and linearly chirped, i.e., different wavelengths are placed in different longitudinal positions. A first polarizer (P) selects a polarization. The laser crosses a non-linear crystal, in this case gallium phosphide, which is one of the most used for its large bandwidth. A second polarizer (A), orthogonal to the first one, allows the signal to cross it only when the polarization is rotated, which happens when the beam passes close (of the order of a few millimetres) to the crystal. A quarter-wave plate removes residual birefringence of the electro-optic crystal by minimizing transmitted light through the analyzer in the absence of an electron bunch. Owing to the linear chirp, different longitudinal positions in the probe laser pulse are rotated in different ways in the crystal, since refractive index is wavelength dependent. The information of the longitudinal beam profile is encoded into the spectrum and can be retrieved by a grating spectrometer. While this was the first implemented scheme, the time resolution is limited, owing to frequency mixing of the Fourier components of the electric field and it is about $T _ { \\mathrm { l i m } } \\approx 2 . 6 \\sqrt { T _ { 0 } T _ { \\mathrm { c } } }$ [57], a value in the range of some hundreds of femtoseconds.  \n  \n The problem of frequency mixing is solved in the electro-optic temporal decoding scheme shown in Fig. 15. It is similar to spectral decoding but the reconstruction of the beam longitudinal profile is different. The intensity-modulated long laser pulse is measured in a single shot using a second short laser probe, realizing a cross-correlation with the principal pulse. The technique is based on the generation of second-harmonic light by crossing the two laser pulses in a non-linear crystal (e.g., barium borate) at an angle. The short gate pulse overlaps different temporal slices of the electro-optic pulse at different spatial positions of the barium borate crystal. Thus the temporal modulation of the electro-optic pulse is transferred to a spatial distribution of the second-harmonic light. The resolution of such a device can be about 40–50 fs, being limited mainly by the crystal absorption bands and the length of the laser probe. The main drawback is the low-efficiency second-harmonic process, requiring $\\approx 1 \\ \\mathrm { m J }$ laser pulse energy.  \n Another single-shot technique is based on non-collinear propagation of the electric pulse and the laser pulse onto the electro-optic crystal, bending the crystal with respect to the beam axis propagation; this is called spatial decoding [58]. At any moment in time, the field in the electro-optic crystal overlaps with only a spatial fraction of the laser pulse. There is a direct correlation with the transverse spatial position within the laser beam and the relative time delay between both pulses because different points across the transverse profile of the probe beam experiences an electric field at different instances in time, and the temporal image of the electric pulse can be impressed on the transverse spatial variation of the probe beam.  \n  \n While the temporal resolution is, in principle, the same as temporal decoding, the advantages of this system lie in the simpler set-up and the possibility of avoiding a second-order harmonic generation. However, a very high surface uniformity of the crystal is required because in such a scheme the laser cannot be focused on the crystal, as in the other schemes, since the spatial size is proportional to the temporal window. This fact could be crucial in the future development of crystals with larger bandwidth, up to $2 0 \\mathrm { T H z }$ , as well as better time resolution, like diethylaminosulfur trifluoride crystals [59], which so far appear to have too rough surfaces to be used for such a task.  \n "

INTRODUCTION  \n Transverse deflection structures (TDS) are well known diagnostics devices for the characterization of the longitudinal properties of electron bunches in a linear accelerator [1–14]. By using a conventional TDS system it is possible to characterize the slice properties of an electron beam in the transverse direction perpendicular to the timedependent streaking. Therefore, typically only either the horizontal or the vertical slice envelopes can be measured. Furthermore, electron beam diagnostic based on a TDS placed downstream of the undulators (postundulator TDS) in conjunction with an electron beam energy spectrometer can indirectly measure the pulse duration of ultrashort photon beams by analyzing the induced energy spread on the electron bunch due to the FEL process [8]. Recently, an innovative design for a TDS was proposed at CERN [15], which gives full control of the angle of the transverse streaking field inside of the TDS to characterize the projections of the beam distribution on different transverse axes, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The possibility of changing the orientation of the streaking field of the TDS to an arbitrary azimuthal angle opens new opportunities for extended beam characterization which makes particular use of the variable streaking direction. For example, a six dimensional (6D) phase-space characterization becomes possible by streaking the beam horizontally and vertically (provided that the phase-advance can be scanned and dispersion can be generated in the two transverse directions). These types of measurements may reveal possible cross correlations between the different phase spaces that cannot be detected with the present measurements using a conventional TDS. Another important application is to retrieve the three dimensional (3D) charge distribution by collecting measurements of the bunches streaked at different angles and combining those using tomographic techniques [16,17]. It is worthwhile noting that this technique could not be realized by using conventional TDSs and makes special use of the possibility of continuously tuning the streaking direction of the dipolelike field in the deflecting structure.  \n  \n  \n Combining these novel and more extended beam characterizations with the already proven capability of achieving fs and sub-fs longitudinal resolution of the $X$ -band TDS [8], this diagnostic tool will be able to provide new insight on the multidimensional-beam-phase-space characterization with sub-fs resolution.  \n As this new TDS design requires very high manufacturing precision to guarantee highest azimuthal symmetry of the structure to avoid the deterioration of the polarization of the streaking field, the high-precision tuning-free assembly procedures developed at PSI for the SwissFEL C-band accelerating structures were used for the manufacturing process [18–22] and also for the realization of the tuning-free $X$ -band structure prototypes for CLIC [23]. In this context and based on the success of the $X$ -band TDS diagnostic at LCLS [8], a collaboration between DESY, PSI and CERN was established to develop and build an advanced modular $X$ -band TDS system with the new feature of providing variable polarization of the deflecting force, namely the polarizable $X$ -band (PolariX) TDS [24–26].  \n During the commissioning of the structure the first threedimensional charge density reconstruction as well as the first slice emittance measurements in both the horizontal and vertical planes were successfully performed. The details of the experimental results have been recently presented in [27].  \n The research discussed in this paper was developed within the PolariX TDS project, which aims at prototyping a series production of the PolariX TDS for applications at DESY and PSI in fs and sub-fs beam diagnostics. The paper has the following structure: In Sec. II, after a brief introduction to the four experiments that are planning to use the PolariX TDS system, a table with the TDS specifications for a design in common to all four experiments is presented; Section III presents the RF design of the TDS and its key components, such as the $X$ -band pulse compressor, E-rotator and phase shifter; Section IV describes the procedure for the prototype fabrication and the low-power measurements verifying the RF performances of the TDS. The section starts by discussing the mechanical design and continues with the description of the manufacturing process and low-power measurements and in particular the bead-pull measurements to verify that the polarization of the dipole field does not rotate along the structure; Section V presents the results of the high-power conditioning of the TDS and XBOC carried out at CERN; Finally, Section VI describes the rf setup for the first experiment in the FLASHForward beamline at DESY where the expected performance of the structure was validated during the first commissioning with electron beam.  \n  \n II. EXPERIMENTS AND TDS SPECIFICATIONS  \n Several experiments at DESY (FLASH2, FLASHForward, SINBAD) and PSI (ATHOS at SwissFEL) are interested in the utilization of high gradient $X$ -band TDS systems for high resolution longitudinal diagnostics [24– 26]. In this section, each of the experiments is introduced and their needs are highlight their needs.  \n A. FLASH2  \n At FLASH1 [28], the direct measurement of the longitudinal phase space with a deflecting rf structure has proven to be of the utmost importance in establishing femtosecondscale photon pulses [29–31]. Based on this experience, the installation of two PolariX TDSs was decided for FLASH2 [32–34]. In order to be compatible with long bunch trains in FLASH2 the streaked bunch is kicked onto an off-axis screen. Downstream of the location foreseen for the PolariX TDSs, FLASH2 comprises a horizontal dipole that separates the electron beam from the FEL beam and can serve as an energy spectrometer. Combining the vertical streak polarization of the PolariX TDSs with this horizontal spectrometer will allow mapping of the full longitudinal phase space density and thereby enhance the operational capabilities for optimization of the longitudinal bunch parameters for the FEL process. The PolariX TDSs at FLASH2 will be installed downstream of the undulator beamline. In such a configuration, the lasing part of the electron bunch can directly be identified. As this measurement can be performed almost parasitically to the regular operation, an estimate of the photon pulse duration can be provided online for the photon users. Additionally, slice emittance measurements in both planes can be performed [33,34]. The experiment aims for a temporal resolution of less than 5 fs.  \n  \n B. FLASHForward  \n The FLASHForward project [35] is an innovative plasma-wakefield acceleration experiment housed at the FLASH FEL facility at DESY [28], aiming to accelerate electrons to GeV energies over a few centimeters of ionized gas. The beams accelerated in this high-gradient regime should ultimately exit the plasma without degradation of their high-quality transverse and longitudinal properties; a goal likely only achievable through rigorous analysis of the longitudinal phase space and slice emittance of both the beams driving the wakefield and those witnessing its accelerating effect. In addition, due to the intrinsically short plasma wavelengths in these schemes, the pulse duration of the accelerated beams may be on the femtosecond scale and thus difficult to resolve with traditional diagnostic methods. As such, a TDS operating at $X$ -band frequency in order to reach the sub-fs resolution and with the ability to resolve beam properties in different transverse planes is the only diagnostic device capable of addressing these needs.  \n C. SINBAD  \n The SINBAD (Short Innovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) facility [36] is dedicated to accelerator research and development, building upon DESYs recent investment in this area in the framework of the Helmholtz ARD program. It will be used for experiments in plasmawakefield acceleration, dielectric accelerating structures and other novel accelerators. The SINBAD-ARES (Accelerator Research Experiment at SINBAD) linac, a  \n $1 0 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ electron linac, will be able to provide very short (sub-fs) electron bunches with low charge (sub-pC), as required for plasma and dielectric experiments [37,38]. The planned PolariX TDS will make the characterization of ARES bunches at the end of the linac possible, which is essential for these experiments [39,40].  \n D. ATHOS at SwissFEL  \n The SwissFEL facility, in operation at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), produces FEL radiation for hard $\\mathbf { X }$ -rays at the ARAMIS beamline [41] and generate soft X-ray radiation for scientific users at the ATHOS beamline from 2021 [42], with pulse durations ranging from a few to several tens of femtoseconds. The goal of ATHOS is to provide a flexible source with advanced control over several pulse properties such as the pulse duration, peak power, and bandwidth. To increase the performance in terms of photon-beam brightness and bandwidth, several innovative lasing schemes and technical developments for some key components are underway [43]. As a diagnostic tool, two PolariX TDSs will be installed downstream of the undulators of the ATHOS beamline, which will allow the indirect measurement of the x-ray pulse length by analyzing the induced energy spread on the electron bunch due to the FEL process. Furthermore, thanks to the variable polarization of the TDS it will be possible to perform a characterization of the 6D phase space by means of measurements of bunch length, energy, and transverse slice emittance (both vertical and horizontal) [44].  \n Table I summarizes the beam parameters, the spatial constraints, and the specifications for the PolariX TDS design for all the experiments listed above. A common mechanical design for the structure is possible by tuning the operational temperature of the structure itself in order to adjust its resonant frequency.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE I.

RF DESIGN  \n The design concept of a TDS with variable polarization of the transverse deflecting kick was presented for the first time in [15] and is illustrated in Fig. 2. The input RF pulse coming from an rf power source is compressed using an rf pulse compressor device and split by a 3 dB hybrid. Although any type of rf pulse compressor can be used, the barrel open cavity (BOC) type is considered in this work due to its numerous advantages described below. The two signals are recombined using a circular waveguide $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ mode launcher, the so-called E-rotator. In one of the waveguide arms a variable rf phase shifter is introduced to control the rf phase difference between the two rf inputs of the E-rotator.  \n The E-rotator combines two input signals into horizontally or vertically linearly polarized $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ modes at the output circular waveguide for rf phase differences of $0 ^ { \\circ }$ or $1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , respectively. This mode is launched into the TDS, which supports both degenerate $\\mathbf { T M } _ { 1 1 0 }$ -like dipole modes and, thus, can operate at any polarization angle. Varying the rf phase difference from $0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , the polarization angle can be changed from horizontal to vertical continuously. At the output of the TDS another E-rotator splits the $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ mode of the circular waveguide into two output waveguides, which have to be terminated individually by rf loads. It is worthwhile mentioning an alternative scheme that using the same rf components can be envisaged based on two identical rf sources with independent rf phase and amplitude controls. Although this scheme would offer a purely electronic way of controlling the TDS polarization with no need for a mechanical rf phase shifter, it has not been the primary choice of this work due to the additional complexity and cost associated with a second rf power source.  \n In this section, the detailed design of the TDS and the associated rf components is presented, with special emphasis on the design of the TDS itself since it is the centerpiece of the whole system which was designed and successfully built for the first time. The design choices made along the way may not be unique but they reflect the expertise available in the PolariX TDS collaboration coming from two important previous experiences. The first one, from the design studies of linear collisions in general and from the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) in particular [45]. The second one, from the most recent developments within the SwissFEL project, where more than 100 C-band acceleration structures have been realized with such a high accuracy of form that no rf tuning was necessary [21]. These fabrication techniques were also successfully applied to $X$ -band accelerating structures and were proved to operate at an accelerating gradient of $1 0 0 \\mathrm { M V / m }$ [23,46]. This technique is essential for the fabrication of the TDS with variable polarization because it avoids the use of dimple tuning, which is not applicable to the TDS with variable polarization, requiring a perfect symmetry of rotation along the entire structure.  \n  \n The main numerical tool for the rf design presented in this section is ANSYS HFSS [47]. Second order elements and a curvilinear tetrahedral mesh were used. For all numerical simulation results presented below numerical convergence was checked not only in terms of internal volume mesh but also in terms of surface mesh quality which is characterized by the deviation of the surface mesh from the true surface. This deviation parameter was set to the level of a few micrometers. The typical level of convergence criteria used in the rf design was set to a level of $- 5 0$ dB for the S-parameter solver and to a level of $1 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ for the relative frequency error in the eigenmode solver. This level of numerical accuracy was considered to be adequate for the design to keep the rf design error below the level of shape accuracy achievable in the fabrication. This is an important consideration for the rf design of devices which will not have any rf tuning features and have to be designed and fabricated with the accuracy required for the operation at the nominal parameters.  \n A. Design of rf components  \n 1. X-band pulse compressor  \n The $X$ -band pulse compressor is based on a single BOC. A BOC makes use of a “whispering gallery” mode which has a large quality factor and has the advantage of requiring only a single resonator instead of two as for the conventional SLED scheme. The design and fabrication of the XBOC are similar to a previous C-band BOC developed and presently used in the SwissFEL Linac [48]. The $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 1 8 , 1 , 1 }$ operating mode is the same while the coupling factor $( \\beta )$ was reduced to 7.5 in order to maximize the energy multiplication factor $( M )$ for the new Q value, klystron pulse length and filling time of the TDS structure. The mechanical design of the XBOC is also very similar to the one of the C-band version. It is composed of an inner body which fully confines the inner resonator, two stainless steel cooling rings that also provide stiffness to the pulse compressor, an external copper ring to close the circular waveguide and an input/output coupler. The C-band BOC is characterized by the complete absence of mechanical tuning at any step of the production and operation. The same approach was successfully used for the XBOC. Because of the extreme compactness of the $X$ -band version and the relative low average power, the cooling circuit was simplified. The six cooling channels of the C-band version were reduced to four and the cooling of the T-shaped coupler was removed as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.  \n  \n The simulated and measured parameters of the BOC with main geometric and rf pulse parameters are reported in Table II.  \n 2. E-rotator  \n Although the rf design of the waveguide components shown in Fig. 2 is described in [15], a short summary is presented here for completeness. The so-called E-rotator is an rf device with two rectangular and one circular waveguide ports. In the circular port two degenerate $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ modes can propagate so that the S-matrix of the E-rotator is a $4 \\times 4$ matrix similar to the one of a standard 3 dB-hybrid. The two output signals have the same amplitude and $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ phase difference. In the output circular port this forms a circularly polarized (rotating) $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ mode from two degenerate linearly polarized $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ modes. This is shown in Fig. 5. If the input signal comes to the rectangular port 1, the output mode is a right-circularly-polarized $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ mode, cf. Fig. 5 (left). If the input signal comes to port 2, a left-circularly-polarized $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ mode is formed, c.f. Fig. 5 (right). A similar device with the same functionality but different design concept, an rf polarizer, is described in [49]. Although designed for pulse compression systems it can also be used for the application described here.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE II.

The operation of the E-rotator as a linearly polarized circular waveguide $\\mathrm { T E } _ { 1 1 }$ mode launcher with variable polarization described above is illustrated in Fig. 6.  \n 3. Variable rf phase shifter  \n Applying the input signal to port 1 of the E-rotator and terminating the circular port 3 with a short circuit will cause full reflection of the circularly polarized wave back into the device. As in the case of a 3 dB-hybrid, the signal then propagates to port 2. Moving the position of the short circuit will change the rf phase of the output signal at port 2 without causing any reflection back to port 1. In this way, the E-rotator serves as variable rf phase shifter. The geometry of the device is shown in Fig. 7 where additionally the electric field distribution in the $x = 0$ plane is shown to visualize the cross section of the movable short circuit. The piston of the movable short has a compact choke integrated at the end which suppresses the penetration of the field into the gap between the piston and the circular waveguide wall. This rf phase shifter was constructed and high power tested. The operation at a peak power level of $3 7 \\ \\mathrm { M W } .$ , a pulse length of 100 ns and a repetition rate of $5 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z }$ was demonstrated [50], which is sufficient for the application to the PolariX TDS.  \n  \n B. rf design of the TDS  \n The TDS is a constant impedance (CI) circular diskloaded waveguide structure operating at $\\mathbf { T M } _ { 1 1 0 }$ -like mode in the backward travelling wave (TW) regime. This is the typical configuration for a TDS operating in TW regime. Several designs exist at different frequencies including S-, $\\mathrm { C } \\mathrm { - }$ and $X$ -bands [9,51]. In all these cases, the TDS cell is not azimuthally symmetric. This is done to avoid degeneracy of the two polarizations of the $\\mathbf { T M } _ { 1 1 0 }$ -like mode and to guarantee that the nominal operation at only one polarization is not perturbed by the other one due to structure imperfections. In the case presented in this paper, the TDS has to support both polarizations and both $\\mathrm { T M } _ { 1 1 0 } .$ - like modes have to remain degenerate. In this case, the natural choice is an azimuthally symmetric cell. This simplifies not only the design but also the fabrication. Moreover, it reduces the cost and, most importantly, improves the achievable accuracy of the shape. The final cell geometry, designed to operate at the PSI rf frequency of 11.9952 GHz specified in Table I, is shown in Fig. 8. Table III summarizes the cell parameters. The choice of these parameters is described in this section.  \n Several parameters were optimized at the level of the single cell design: the cell length $h$ is defined by the choice of the rf phase advance per cell $\\delta \\phi _ { 0 }$ ; the cell radius $b$ is used to tune the eigenfrequency of the cell $f _ { 0 }$ to the operating frequency; the rounding radius of the cell $r r$ is maximized to increase the Q-factor of the cell $\\boldsymbol { Q }$ ; the ratio of the major to the minor axis of the elliptical iris $e$ is optimized to minimize the surface fields on the iris. In particular, great care was taken to minimize the modified Poynting vector $S _ { c }$ [52]. The resulting distribution of the normalized Poynting vector $S _ { c } / G _ { \\perp } ^ { 2 }$ on the cell surface is shown in Fig. 9 (right), where $G _ { \\perp }$ is the transverse deflecting gradient. For comparison, the normalized distribution of the surface electric $E _ { s } / G _ { \\perp }$ and magnetic field $H _ { s } / G _ { \\perp }$ are also shown in Fig. 9 (left) and (middle), respectively. The maximum values of the normalized surface fields and rf parameters of the cell are shown in Table III. This includes the group velocity $v _ { g }$ which is negative in the backward TW structure and transverse shunt impedance per meter length $R _ { \\perp } ^ { \\prime }$ .  \n Table: Caption: TABLE III.

To achieve this, a formalism was used which was developed for the optimization of a linac operating with a SLED-type rf pulse compression system in the single bunch regime, when the compressed pulse length is equal to the structure filling time $t _ { f } = L / v _ { g }$ . The formalism is summarized in [53] and in the references therein. Substituting the accelerating shunt impedance $R ^ { \\prime }$ and voltage $V$ with the transverse shunt impedance $R _ { \\perp } ^ { \\prime }$ and the deflecting voltage $V _ { \\perp }$ , the formalism can be directly applied to the case of the TDS with BOC. Then, the effective transverse shunt impedance per meter length $R _ { \\perp , \\mathrm { T D S } } ^ { \\prime } = V _ { \\perp } ^ { 2 } / P _ { k } L$ , where $P _ { k }$ is the peak power from the klystron, can be calculated and used as a figure of merit. In Fig. 10 (solid line), the impedance of the TDS with BOC normalized to the cell impedance is plotted versus TDS attenuation $\\tau = t _ { f } f _ { 0 } \\pi / Q$ for a klystron pulse length of $t _ { k } = 1 5 0 0$ ns and a BOC Q-factor of $Q _ { 0 } = 1 5 0 0 0 0$ . The optimum value of the TDS attenuation is given by the position of the maximum of this curve which is at $\\tau = 0 . 6 6 5$ . For fixed cell parameters, this defines the optimum length $L _ { 0 }$ of the TDS. Furthermore, by varying the external Q-factor $Q _ { e }$ its optimum value was found to be $Q _ { e } = 1 9 8 0 0$ . This is the value used for the plot in Fig. 10. Lower or higher values of $Q _ { e }$ result in lower $R _ { \\mathrm { \\perp , T D S } } ^ { \\prime }$ . For comparison, the dashed line shows the effective impedance of the TDS without BOC, clearly demonstrating the strong effect of rf pulse compression. Using this approach, the optimum TDS length $L _ { 0 }$ was found for different values of the iris thickness which was varied from $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ to $3 . 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and is shown in Fig. 11 (dashed). The smaller the value of $d$ , the higher the effective impedance, which is presented in Fig. 11 (blue solid line) normalized to its maximum value for $d = 1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . In addition, the inverse value of the maximum of $S _ { c }$ in the TDS is shown. Opposite to the impedance, a smaller $d$ results in higher $S _ { c }$ with a minimum around $d = 3 . 1 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ . Considering both functions as a figure of merit, an iris thickness value of $2 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ was chosen in the region where the blue and red lines cross each other. This also defines the optimum TDS active length $L _ { 0 } = 0 . 9 3 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ . The impact of the two remaining parameters, $a$ and $\\delta \\phi _ { 0 }$ on the parameters and the performance of the TDS was also analyzed. Although no optimum was found within the range of varying $a$ from $4 \\mathrm { m m }$ to $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ and $\\delta \\phi _ { 0 }$ from $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $1 5 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , limited by practical rather than fundamental considerations, the following conclusions were drawn, leading to the final choice of $a = 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ and $\\delta \\phi = 1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . First of all, Table IV clearly demonstrates that a reduction of $a$ from $5 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ used in the previous $X$ -band design [51] to $4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ significantly improves the TDS performance. In particular, it increases $R _ { \\perp , T D S } ^ { \\prime }$ by $30 \\%$ and at the same time it reduces the ratio of maximum $S _ { c }$ in the TDS to the square of its average transverse deflecting gradient by $40 \\%$ . The former will result in $30 \\%$ less rf power for the same deflecting gradient, the latter in $20 \\%$ higher achievable deflecting gradient if it is limited by the rf breakdowns. There are several disadvantages of a smaller aperture including a tighter limit on the electron or photon beam transmission and stronger longitudinal and transverse wakefields.  \n  \n  \n The longitudinal and transverse wake-potentials for a structure having $4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ aperture has been calculated using Karl Bane’s analytical model, which assumes an infinitely long periodic structure [54,55]. The result of the calculation is shown in Fig. 12. From these plots, it is possible to derive the integrated induced energy spread and emittance growth after the transit through the structure using the analytical equations described in [56]. As an example, some calculations valid for the SINBAD-ARES linac case—which operates with the lowest beam energy—are presented. If a $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { M e V }$ bunch with a charge of $2 . 7 \\ \\mathrm { p C }$ and a length of 0.7 fs rms traveling along a $2 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ -long TDS is considered, the corresponding estimated increase in energy spread at the exit of the structure will be $\\Delta E < 4 { \\mathrm { ~ k e V } }$ . Also, the increase of the transverse emittance will be completely negligible. The situation is different for a beam with $2 0 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ charge and a length of 1 ps. The latter would experience an increase in energy spread $\\Delta E = 1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { k e V }$ . The same beam for a $2 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ transverse trajectory offset in the structure would undergo an increase of the normalized emittance of about $5 \\%$ . These effects were analyzed for all experiments and it was concluded that $a = 4 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ is an acceptable value for the TDS iris aperture.  \n The photon beam transmission is relevant for ATHOS since the TDS is located in a post-undulator location. The distance between the first undulator stage and the TDS system is about $4 0 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ , and the worst case is the two color operation with the first undulator stage tuned to the longest wavelength of $5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ [42]. In this case, the divergence is approximately 25 μrad providing an rms photon beam radius of $1 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ at the TDS location which is enough for the photon beam transmission.  \n Finally, Table IV shows the effect of a larger rf phase advance per cell on the TDS parameters. Increasing this parameter results in some reduction of both the TDS shunt impedance and the maximum value of $S _ { c }$ , therefore, resulting in no advantage. Nonetheless, a higher rf phase advance per cell results in a smaller value of the optimum active length $L _ { 0 }$ . This makes it an attractive solution if there are severe constraints on the total length of the TDS. However, this is not the case for any of the facilities described in Table I. In order to couple rf power into the TDS with no reflections, a matching cell is introduced between the circular waveguide port of the input E-rotator and the TDS. The same is done at the TDS output for terminating the leftover rf power by means of the output E-rotator and two rf loads.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE IV.

The shape of the matching cell is similar to that of the regular cell, but the dimensions are rather different. The cell radius and iris radius are used as parameters for matching. The cell length and the iris shape were optimized to minimize both electric and magnetic surface fields as well as $S _ { c }$ in the matching cell to be lower than in the first regular cell, where they are the highest. This ensures that the high gradient performance is not limited by the matching cell and results in a slightly longer matching cell and a thicker asymmetric matching iris. The length of the circular waveguide between the E-rotator and the matching iris is minimized but it is still long enough to guarantee that the matching is not affected by the evanescent modes. The total length of the rf power coupler including beam pipe, E-rotator, circular waveguide and matching cell is $8 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . The output rf coupler is the same as the input one, thus twice this length must be added to the active length to obtain the total length from flange to flange of the TDS. For practical reasons two versions of the TDS were selected for fabrication. A short version, $9 6 0 \\mathrm { m m }$ long, and a longer and more efficient structure about $1 1 6 0 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ long. Table $\\mathrm { \\Delta V }$ lists the rf parameters for both versions together with the optimum one for comparison. The length of the optimum TDS is in between the two, and both are very close to the optimum TDS in terms of impedance per meter length, but the long TDS has higher total impedance $R _ { \\mathrm { \\perp , T D S } } = R _ { \\mathrm { \\perp , T D S } } ^ { \\prime } L _ { 0 }$ because it is longer. The short version, matching the space constraints at FLASH2 at DESY [24,57], was fabricated as a first prototype.  \n  \n Table: Caption: TABLE V. rf parameters for short and long $X$ -band TDS.

PROTOTYPE FABRICATION AND BEAD-PULL MEASUREMENTS  \n A. Tolerance study and slippage effects for operation at zero-crossing  \n In order to estimate the slippage effect between the electron bunch and the synchronous deflecting wave due to cell-to-cell phase advance errors $( \\delta \\phi )$ the electron beam trajectories in the TDS were estimated. The following iterative equation of motion of the beam centroid in the horizontal plane for each ith cell was considered  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { x ( i ) = x ( i - 1 ) + x ^ { \\prime } ( i - 1 ) h + \\displaystyle \\frac { e E _ { \\perp } ( i ) } { 2 E _ { 0 } } \\sin [ \\phi ( i ) ] h ^ { 2 } , \\hfill } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle x ^ { \\prime } ( i ) = x ^ { \\prime } ( i - 1 ) + \\displaystyle \\frac { e E _ { \\perp } ( i ) } { E _ { 0 } } \\sin [ \\phi ( i ) ] h , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n for $i = 2 . . . N + 2$ , where $N$ is the number of cells, $h$ is the cell period and $E _ { 0 }$ is the beam energy in $\\mathrm { e V . }$ . The deflecting field $E _ { \\perp } ( i )$ in each ith cell is given by  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { \\displaystyle E _ { \\perp } ( i ) = E _ { \\perp } ( 1 ) \\exp \\left[ - \\frac { \\tau _ { 0 } } { l } p ( i - 2 ) \\right] , } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle E _ { \\perp } ( 1 ) = \\frac { V _ { \\perp } } { l } \\frac { \\tau _ { 0 } } { 1 - \\exp ( - \\tau _ { 0 } ) } , } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n where $l$ is the active length, $V _ { \\perp }$ is the integrated deflecting voltage and $\\tau _ { 0 }$ the total power attenuation parameter as listed in Table V. The integrated phase advance error $\\phi ( i )$ is finally given by  \n $$\n\\phi ( i ) = \\phi ( i - 1 ) + \\Delta \\delta \\phi _ { T } + \\Delta \\delta \\phi _ { M , i } + \\varphi _ { r f }\n$$ \n where $\\Delta \\delta \\phi _ { M , i }$ is the phase advance error due to systematic and random mechanical errors in the $i$ -th cell, $\\Delta \\delta \\phi _ { T } =$ $c / v _ { g } \\alpha \\delta \\phi _ { 0 } \\delta T$ is the phase advance variation due to a temperature variation and $\\alpha = 1 . 8 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 } ~ \\mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ is the copper expansion coefficient. $\\varphi _ { r f }$ is the rf phase with $\\varphi _ { r f } = 0 ^ { \\circ }$ corresponding to the zero-crossing. The initial conditions are $x ( { \\bar { 1 } } ) = x ^ { \\prime } ( 1 ) = 0$ because the mechanical errors in the input/output coupler are not considered in this analysis.  \n Table VI lists the results of the sensitivity analysis of the frequency versus geometrical error for different dimensions as indicated in Fig. 8. As expected the external cell radius $( b )$ is the most sensitive parameter and is considered as an estimate of the phase advance error in the following analysis.  \n Table: Caption: TABLE VI. Sensitivity analysis of the frequency and cell-tocell phase advance versus geometrical error for different dimensions as indicated in Fig. 8 and listed in Table III. The relation $\\Delta f / f _ { 0 } = - v _ { g } / c \\cdot \\Delta ( \\delta \\phi ) / \\delta \\phi _ { 0 }$ is used.

(1) and (2). Based on this consideration, the most critical application for the TDS is the SINBAD setup due to lowest beam energy of $1 0 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ and the relatively high integrated deflecting voltage. For this reason, only the SINBAD case is considered in the following studies. It is important to emphasize that the systematic mechanical errors can also be compensated by a temperature regulation system. For this purpose, a temperature regulation system must be used to keep the beam offset and transverse kick inside the TDS under control. In particular, in case of installation of two TDSs in the same beamline, each of them has to have a dedicated temperature regulation system to compensate its own phase advance systematic errors. These errors can be well characterized by low power rf measurements and the operational temperature to minimize these effect can be also estimated. Nevertheless, the random cell-to-cell errors cannot be fully compensated by the temperature regulation and a dedicated study of random cell-to-cell phase errors was performed to evaluate their impact on the beam trajectory. In particular the impact on the residual offset and transverse kicks at the TDS exit were studied.  \n  \n Based on the experience with the ultra precision (UP)- machining of the SwissFEL C-band accelerating structures the inner profile of a single cup should be within the tolerance of $\\pm 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . Considering the geometrical sensitivity listed in Table VI and a tolerance of $\\pm 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , a normal distribution for the phase advance errors along the TDS with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of $0 . 2 5 ^ { \\circ }$ was chosen to generate a number of configurations having random cell-to-cell phase advance errors, as shown in Fig. 14.  \n Figure 15 shows the effect of the tuning errors for 50 random configurations on the transverse displacement (up) and on the transverse kick (bottom) as a function of the coordinate along the TDS axis. The beam energy is $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m e V }$ and the integrated deflecting voltage is $V _ { \\perp } = 2 0 ~ \\mathrm { M V }$ . The beam offset and residual transverse kick at the TDS exit resulted to be $1 . 4 \\mathrm { ~ m m }$ rms and 3.9 mrad rms, respectively.  \n The residual beam offset and the transverse kick at the TDS exit can still be compensated by globally adjusting the rf phase. In the following, the zero-crossing rf phase is defined as the phase for which the transverse kick at the TDS exit is zero. Figure 16 shows the beam trajectory and the transverse kick along the TDS axis for the worse case in Fig. 15 and different rf phases around the zero-crossing. As can be seen in Fig. 16, the TDS has no residual transverse kick at the TDS exit and the residual beam offset is also under control and is approximately $0 . 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ at the TDS exit. However, all these considerations are based on the assumption that the errors of the phase advance are only caused by mechanical machining tolerances. This is not necessarily true, since brazing and assembly play a key role in defining the correct geometry and phase advance.  \n  \n B. Mechanical design  \n The mechanical design is very similar to that of the SwissFEL C-band structure and PSI $\\mathrm { T } 2 4 X$ -band structures [18,19,22,23], with the main difference in the input/output power couplers. For the PolariX TDS they comprise an E-rotator geometry as shown in Fig. 5. Figure 17 shows a section of the mechanical drawing of the TDS. It is composed of seven different kinds of disks: three for the couplers, three special disks to adapt the two sides of the coupler to the regular disks, and 95 and 119 regular identical disks for the short and the long version of the TDS, respectively. As for the C-band accelerating structures, a double rounded cell (T-shape) design was chosen, see Fig. 18 (right). Thanks to the absence of any tuning feature, machining of the half cell will be subsequently performed on both sides with the aim of having the brazing plane in the middle of the cell. This design avoids placing the brazing copper-silver alloy in one brazing groove to flow into the structure through capillary action. Furthermore, sharp edges are foreseen in the cells in order to eventually hold the melted brazing material back from flowing into the cells. However, the size of the brazing groove was experimentally optimized in order to fully fill the brazing gaps with the melted brazing material. The diameter of the iris and the cell radius is constant from cell to cell to generate a constant impedance gradient along the structure. The phase advance per cell is $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ as discussed in the previous section. The design of the copper cell includes two round brazing joints to effectively separate the vacuum from the water cooling. Air channels allow checking for vacuum tightness after brazing. The discussion in the Sec. IVA fixed the tolerance for the inner profile of the cups to $\\pm 3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . Furthermore, based on the experience gathered from the high power test with C-band and $X$ -band accelerating structures at PSI, an average surface roughness ${ \\cal R } _ { a }$ below $2 5 ~ \\mathrm { { \\ n m } }$ was specified. This extremely high accuracy in the machining of the cups is required in order to avoid tuning and guarantee any rotation of the dipole polarization.  \n  \n The highest power loss of $3 ~ \\mathrm { k W }$ will be achieved in the ATHOS application for a repetition rate of $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { H z } .$ , an rf pulse length of $1 . 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ and an integrated voltage of $6 0 \\ : \\mathrm { M V } .$ Finite element (FE) calculations were performed to verify that thermal dissipation and temperature stabilization can be achieved by water flowing through eight azimuthally distributed channels integrated in each disk of the structure and running all along it. The design pressure of these $8 \\mathrm { m m }$ - diameter channels is around 6 bar, and the foreseen flow velocity is around $1 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ . The cooling circuits are integrated in the disks as shown in Fig. 18 (right). The nominal inlet temperature of the water is $3 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and will be stabilized within $\\pm 0 . 0 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . Figure 19 shows a typical temperature distribution in the TDS model with few disks. A global tuning of the TDS can be performed by varying the inlet temperature of the water within $\\pm 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ of the nominal temperature.  \n C. Manufacturing process  \n Following the C-band tuning-free technology developed at PSI for the SwissFEL linac [20,21], the main production steps are summarized here:  \n (i) Machining and visual inspection of the UP-parts. All cups and the two couplers were produced by the company VDL [58]. In order to verify the cup size all the cups had metrology control. The histogram in Fig. 20 shows the metrology results for the inner diameter of the cups: the cups have a systematic error of $- 0 . 1 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , the error distribution has a standard deviation of $0 . 7 7 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ and a peak to peak difference of $2 . 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . Interferometric probing of the copper surface was used to measure the surface roughness and the surfaces were scanned for possible defects using microscopic inspection. Figure 21 shows a typical picture of the interferometric probing of the precision copper surface. The surface roughness ${ \\cal R } _ { a }$ was measured as $1 4 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . The inner profiles of the cups are all well within the specified tolerances $( \\pm 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ and the average surface roughness ${ \\cal R } _ { a }$ is below $1 5 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ .  \n (ii) Metrology at PSI on a few spare disks/parts as a cross-check.   \n(iii) Vacuum firing of parts: The cups were vacuum fired at $4 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ for two hours before stacking in order to remove residual oxidation.   \n(iv) Hand stacking was employed instead of using the robot as in the series production of the C-band accelerating structures. The stacking is based on a pre-heating ( $\\Delta T = 5 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ) shrink-fit design.   \n(v) Vacuum brazing.   \n(vi) Vacuum leak test.   \n(vii) Pressure test on cooling channels $9 \\mathrm { b a r ( g ) }$ using $\\Nu _ { 2 }$ .   \n(viii) Vacuum leak test (integral).   \n(ix) Metrology straightness. Figure 22 shows the full TDS prototype. To check for possible elongation or shrinking and for the perpendicularity along the  \n 90 cm-long structure, the length and the axial deviations are measured with a laser tracker. Typical results are depicted in Fig. 23 with an axial deviation of $\\pm 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ rms. The length measured between reference planes corresponds well to the reference length of $8 3 8 . 3 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ minus $3 7 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ .  \n D. rf characterization and bead-pull measurements  \n The measurements were performed with a 4-port vector network analyzer (VNA), connecting each port of the TDS to one port of the VNA, according to the scheme described in Fig. 24 (right). Properly combining the measured Sparameters, this setup made both the TDS reflection coefficient and insertion loss measurements possible. The insertion loss was obtained from $S _ { 3 1 } + S _ { 4 1 }$ and the reflection coefficient from $S _ { 1 1 } + S _ { 1 2 }$ . As shown in the plot of Fig. 24 (left), the values measured at the nominal frequency are $- 5 . 5 ~ \\mathrm { d B }$ and $- 3 5 { \\mathrm { ~ d B } }$ , respectively.  \n The bead-pull technique was used to measure the field flatness and the dipole mode polarization. The structure was fixed to a metallic frame and aligned in vertical position. A step motor was used to drive a dielectric sphere with a diameter of $2 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ along the structure, fixed to a dielectric wire having a diameter of $0 . 1 6 ~ \\mathrm { m m }$ . Taking the coordinate system, sketched in Fig. 24 (right), as reference, the bead pulling was done along several paths parallel to the $z$ -axis, with different offsets in $x$ or $y .$ . A spherical, dielectric bead perturbs only the electric field, and cannot distinguish between longitudinal and transverse components. However, the measurement still provides information about each single components of the E-field. To this purpose, it is useful to remember that for an ideal structure:  \n (i) along the $z$ -axis, the transverse component of $E$ rotates from $x$ to $y$ when the phase difference between port 1 and port 2 $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } } )$ varies from $1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $0 ^ { \\circ }$ . The longitudinal component, $E _ { z } ( z )$ , is zero on the $\\mathbf { z }$ -axis;   \n(ii) moving out from the $z$ -axis, for example with a given $x$ -axis offset, also $E _ { z } ( z )$ depends on $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ and it increases from zero to its maximum when $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$  \n sweeps from $0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . Moreover, as shown in Fig. 25, where the cartesian components of the E-field are plotted along one cell from iris to iris, $E _ { z } ( z )$ reaches the maximum value in the middle of the cell where the transverse components reach their minimum. On the opposite, the $E _ { z } ( z )$ reaches its minimum value for $z$ corresponding to the iris positions where the transverse components reach their maximum value;  \n (iii) If the offset is in the $y$ -axis, the plots in Fig. 25 are still valid exchanging $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } } = 0 ^ { \\circ }$ with $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } } = 1 8 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , and $E _ { x }$ with $E _ { y }$ .  \n Figure 26 (top) shows the electric field as obtained from an on-axis bead-pull measurement. According to what stated above, this field pattern is the transverse component of $E$ , which, varying $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ , rotates in the $x y$ -plane. Figure 26 (bottom) reports the cell-to-cell phase advance. It resulted to be $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ with a dispersion of $0 . 6 7 ^ { \\circ }$ rms at the working frequency of $1 1 9 9 5 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { M H z }$ and a temperature of $3 3 . 9 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . It is worth noting that same results for the phase advance were obtained varying $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ from $0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $3 6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ with a step of $1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , namely for different polarizations. With this set up only the transverse component of the electric field $E _ { \\perp }$ was measured.  \n In order to verify that the different polarizations are also well tuned, bead-pull measurements were performed for different offset values and relative phases between the ports resulting in different polarizations. For this scope, the wire guiding the bead was moved out of the $z$ -axis, introducing an offset of $1 \\mathrm { m m }$ in the $x$ -axis. The first three plots in the top of Fig. 27 show the measured field patterns for three different values of $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ . Comparing these three plots to the expected E-field components in Fig. 25, one can observe that the oscillation peaks of the measured field, marked with red dots, identify the iris positions, while the negative peaks, marked with green dots, identify the cell gap center.  \n Thus, changing the polarization, the transverse component of $E$ rotates but its amplitude remains constant. On the contrary, the longitudinal component varies from zero to its maximum when the polarization changes from one plane to its orthogonal one. In addition, one can also observe that in the gap center the amplitude of the transverse component of electric field is almost independent of $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ . One concludes that the variation of the height of the line determined by the green points with $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ is due to the longitudinal component of electric field. For $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } } = 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , $E _ { z } ( z )$ is expected to be zero, then it starts to increase to reach the maximum amplitude for $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } } = 1 8 0 ^ { \\circ } .$ . The height of the green dots confirms these expectations. Along the TDS, for any given $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ , the alignment of the green dots can be fitted by a first order polynomial (the slope is due to the power losses along the TDS, which is a constant impedance structure). Since the standard deviation of the errors from this linear fit is practically zero, one can conclude that the polarization of the dipole fields does not have any rotation along the structure. The average of all the green dot values as a function of $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ is presented in the plot at the bottom of Fig. 27. From the measurements this function, $E _ { \\mathrm { m i n } }$ , has a minimum at $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } } = - 1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , and not at $0 ^ { \\circ }$ as expected. This discrepancy can be justified by an error in the wire alignment that was made manually. If the offset is not purely in the $x$ -axis but the wire is also slightly displaced along the $y$ -axis, the value of $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ which minimizes $E _ { \\mathrm { m i n } }$ is slightly shifted from zero.  \n 1. Slippage effect due to phase advance errors  \n As stated in Sec. IVA the effects of the measured phase advance errors on the beam trajectory are estimated with the equation of motion 1. Figure 28 (top) shows the average integrated phase error along the TDS axis and the integrated phase error for different polarizations with $\\Delta \\phi _ { \\mathrm { i n } }$ from $0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $3 6 0 ^ { \\circ }$ with a step of $1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . Figure 28 also shows the effect of the phase advance errors on the transverse displacement of the centroid (middle) and on the angular divergence (bottom) as a function of the longitudinal coordinate inside the TDS and for different rf phases. As an example, we used the SINBAD-ARES linac application, which operates with the lowest beam energy of $1 0 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ and the integrated deflecting voltage is $2 0 \\ : \\mathrm { M V } .$ . Residual effects of the cell-tocell phase advance errors can still be compensated by globally adjusting the rf phase. In this case, the residual kick can be compensated with an rf phase of $- 2 . 8 ^ { \\circ }$ and then only an offset of $- 1 . 2 \\ \\mathrm { m m }$ remains. For the application at SINBAD, where the operation of two TDSs in series is foreseen, the presence of this offset requires some flexibility in the precise adjustment of the second TDS. In particular this aspect was addressed with the design of a remote position adjustment system for the positioning of both structures.  \n V. HIGH POWER TESTS  \n Following the low power measurement, the structure was installed in CERN’s XBOX2 facility for high power testing [59]. XBOX2 is equipped with a 50 MW CPI klystron with a repetition rate of $5 0 \\mathrm { { H z } }$ and at the time of testing a pulse compression scheme consisting of a prototype BOC described above and CCC (correction cavity chain) [60]. The CCC comprises eight spherical cavities and provides a passive means of pulse shape correction to produce the high power flat top while offering improved efficiency over doing so via phase and amplitude modulation [61].  \n Figure 29 shows the structure installed in CERN’s high power test stand.  \n The polarization was controlled during testing via a high-power variable phase shifter placed on one of the input arms of the PolariX TDS as shown in Fig. 30. The phase shifter was of the aforementioned design and had previously been conditioned in XBOX3 up to a peak power of $4 4 \\mathrm { M W }$ at 50 ns and 37 MW at 200 ns [50]. As the XBOX2 test stand is a facility without beam capability, it was not possible to measure the polarization via spectrometric methods. Instead, the polarization during testing was inferred by using the LLRF system to measure the phase difference between the two directional couplers connected to the structure outputs also shown in the experimental setup in Fig. 30.  \n Similar to previously tested components an automated conditioning algorithm was used to gradually increase the input power while maintaining a fixed BDR (breakdown rate) of $3 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ bpp (breakdowns per pulse) [62]. Typically, during structure conditioning a 50 ns pulse is used in the initial stages and the pulse length is later increased gradually in steps. However, due to the short window available for testing the pulse length was fixed to 100 ns for the duration of the test, as this corresponds approximately to the fill time of the structure. Conventional accelerating structures operate in the $\\mathbf { T M } _ { 0 1 0 }$ -like mode where the internal field pattern is azimuthally symmetric, meaning that the cavity surface conditions evenly. In a TDS, however, the field necessarily varies azimuthally due to the established $\\mathbf { T M } _ { 1 1 0 }$ -like deflecting mode. As the PolariX TDS is capable of varying the polarization during operation it presents a unique case where the surface peak electric and magnetic fields may be completely redistributed and hence each polarization must be conditioned separately. To expose the entire surface to high surface electric fields and ensure the structure is capable of highpower operation in different polarizations the variable phase shifter was moved several times during the test to rotate the field orientation.  \n Figure 31 shows the full conditioning history alongside the polarization for each period. The conditioning began at an arbitrary polarization angle with the phase shifter in the fully retracted position in order to expose the entire internal surface to high power rf. Initially, it was planned that the surface would be conditioned evenly by moving the phase shifter every 5 MW then recommencing in a different polarization. For this reason, the phase shifter was moved remotely during testing after approximately 10 million pulses. A change in phase was observed, however, the system was then limited by high vacuum levels in the region surrounding the phase shifter. Further attempts at remote actuation were unsuccessful, and so after 20 million pulses the device was removed, reset manually and reinstalled with the piston in the central position. Conditioning proceeded normally and after approximately 30 million pulses the decision was made to once again actuate the phase shifter remotely. As before, an immediate phase shift was observed, however, the system was then limited by vacuum activity and not BDR. Attempts to remotely reposition the device were once again unsuccessful due to what is believed to be a problem with the magnetic coupling of the mechanical drive system. A further intervention to remove and reset the device was performed after approximately 45 million pulses and it was decided not to vary the polarization again for the remainder of the testing period. The FLASHForward [35] beamline at DESY operates a 6 MW Toshiba E37113A klystron with plans to install an XBOC to increase the peak power by a factor of 4. After 60 million pulses the PolariX TDS had exceeded this value in the test, reaching a peak input power of $2 6 . 5 \\mathrm { M W }$ at a polarization of ${ \\approx } 1 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . It was then decided to cease ramping and run at a fixed input power and decreased BDR for the remainder of the test to avoid the risk of damaging the structure. Additionally, given the azimuthal symmetry of the cells it was assumed that the structure would be capable of operation at this power level in any polarization. No upper limit emerged during the test and results indicate that the structure is capable of establishing the deflecting voltage required in the FLASH beamline.  \n  \n  \n Where possible, all breakdowns occurring in the PolariX TDS were localized via the edge method [63] to monitor the structure health and progress during conditioning. The distribution of breakdowns occurring in the structure is shown in Fig. 32 and the corresponding phase distribution of each breakdown event was calculated in Fig. 33. Although a structure-long spread is present, the vast majority of breakdowns occurred close to the structure input and/or in the first few cells. However, this is an expected behaviour since the PolariX TDS is a constant impedance structure where the highest fields are present in the first cells and then decay accordingly. Additionally, the phase of the breakdown events populate three distinct regions separated by approximately $1 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , corresponding to the phase advance of each cell, and suggesting that breakdowns tend to occur on the irises. The combined time and phase of these results are summarized in Fig. 34.  \n The power test also offered the possibility to evaluate the high power performance of the XBOC. This pulse compressor was tested longer than the TDS structure, since it was left in the high power network also for the following test of the CLIC superstructure reaching a total of 2550 hours or 450 million pulses. During this time the  \n XBOC was tested up to $1 2 ~ \\mathrm { M W }$ input power at a pulse length of 104.5 ns and was operating mainly at $7 . 5 \\mathrm { M W }$ and a pulse length of $7 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n s } }$ . The device ran very smoothly showing vacuum activity or breakdowns very rarely. It was not possible to clearly distinguish between events in the CCC and XBOC and a simple estimation indicates the total amount of breakdowns in the XBOC was in a range of 100 to 200. This corresponds to a BDR in the $1 0 ^ { - 7 }$ range. Because of the rarity of events in the pulse compressor, the evaluated BDR cannot be considered as the final result of the high power performance of the device but as an indication of the partial conditioning. In the ATHOS line of the SwissFEL the maximum operational value of the $X$ -band klystron is $2 5 \\mathrm { M W }$ peak power and a pulse length of 1500 ns at $1 0 0 \\mathrm { H z }$ , which corresponds, after losses in the long waveguide, to $1 9 \\ \\mathrm { M W }$ input power for the XBOC. This value is clearly much larger than the power level during the test in the XBOX. Nevertheless, the very smooth operation and the rarity of events are clear indications that the device was only partially conditioned and far from the high power limits.  \n VI. RF SETUP AT DESY  \n In summer 2019, after the successful high power tests at CERN, the PolariX TDS prototype was installed at DESY in the FLASHForward beamline. Figure 35 shows the PolariX TDS after installation and the rf station feeding the structure. The FLASHForward and FLASH2 experiments designed a shared rf station that in the future will feed either the FLASHForward TDS or the FLASH2 TDSs installed in the two neighbor beamlines. For the commissioning of the PolariX TDS prototype a much simpler setup feeding only the TDS installed at FLASHForward was employed. In the next subsections, we will describe the main subsets of components which were installed in preparation of the commissioning of the structure with an electron beam in more detail.  \n A. rf components  \n The structure is driven by a 6 MW Toshiba klystron E37113A operated at a frequency of 11.988 GHz. The modulator to provide the high voltage (HV) to the klystron is semiconductor switch, designed and built by AMPEGON/PPT [64]. The modulator is split into a control and switching unit, located outside the accelerator enclosure, and a klystron unit containing the pulse transformer and klystron, located close to the structure inside the enclosure. Two switches are operated in parallel at a voltage of $2 . 6 ~ \\mathrm { k V } .$ .  \n To achieve a good matching to the impedance of the pulse transformer and klystron the switches are connected via two bundles of up to 16 RG213 cables. The cables are $1 5 \\mathrm { ~ m ~ }$ long, which provides flexibility in the placement of the pulse transformer of up to $2 \\mathrm { m }$ . The klystron can deliver up to $2 \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ rf while the HV pulse can be $6 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ long. Thus, it was decided to use a relatively slow rise time of the HV pulse of up to $2 \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ to possibly alleviate problems due to the unusually long pulse cables. The rise time achieved was $1 . 5 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { s }$ .  \n The klystron is located between the FLASH2 beamline and the FLASHForward beamline. In the initial setup the klystron is directly connected to the input network of the PolariX TDS in the FLASHForward beamline. In a second evolution of the setup, a variable waveguide switch will be used to switch the power between one structure in the FLASHForward beamline and two structures in the FLASH2 beamline. A ceramic window separates the waveguide from the beam vacuum system. A fixed shunt T-splitter is used to split the rf evenly into two waveguide arms. In one arm, a variable phase shifter of the same type as used at CERN can rotate the phase between $0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . The phase shifter was rf conditioned prior to the installation in the accelerator. The conditioning time up to full power was 2 days and no problems were observed afterwards at any position of the phase shifter. The limit of $2 0 0 ^ { \\circ }$ for the phase shifter was established as a precaution after the unfortunate experience during the conditioning at CERN although no problems were observed up to settings of $3 0 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . There is one directional coupler in the common waveguide at the entrance of the structure and one directional coupler at each exit before the rf absorbers.  \n  \n The initial commissioning of the system was done with a pulse length of 2 ns at a power of 6 MW. Subsequently, it was possible to increase the pulse length. The majority of the measurements were done with rf pulses of 400 ns flat top plus a linear decay over 100 ns. The latter proved to be beneficial to reduce reflections in the system. Meanwhile, a flat top length of 700 ns was established for stable operation at 6 MW.  \n B. Low level rf concept  \n As the PolariX TDS is the first $X$ -band structure installed on the DESY campus, there are no means available to measure, control and drive its rf field. Already existing LLRF systems are used to operate structures at $1 . 3 \\ \\mathrm { G H z }$ (FLASH, EuXFEL) or $3 \\mathrm { G H z }$ (SINBAD, REGAE). For the $X$ -band LLRF system, the $1 2 ~ \\mathrm { G H z }$ signals will be downconverted to $3 ~ \\mathrm { G H z }$ allowing the use of already existing processing components and greatly reducing the need for new developments.  \n Figure 36 shows the block diagram of the LLRF system for the PolariX TDS at FLASHForward. As described above, the general approach is to reuse already existing components. These are the frequency generation box (FGB), the universal local oscillator generation module (UniLOGM) [65] and the S-band LLRF system already available in MicroTCA.4 [66]. The FGB takes the $1 . 3 \\mathrm { G H z }$ reference signal and converts it to $3 ~ \\mathrm { G H z }$ . This step is needed, as the rest of the system is built to also be used at, e.g., SINBAD which is operated using a reference signal of 3 GHz. This signal is fed into the UniLOGM which provides all needed signals for the digitization and processing in the S-band MicroTCA.4 system.  \n  \n The $X$ -band local oscillator generation module (XLOGM), the $X$ -band down-converter module (XDWCM) and the $X$ -band down-converter module with up-conversion (XDWCM_UPC) are newly designed $1 9 ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ modules. The XLOGM converts the reference signals up to $9 \\operatorname { G H z }$ , which is then used as an Local Oscillator (LO) for rf mixers in the XDWCM to convert the measured $1 2 \\mathrm { { G H z } }$ signals from the PolariX down to $3 \\mathrm { G H z }$ . The XDWCM_UPC contains an upconversion channel for the drive signal which is fed into the klystron.  \n C. Precision temperature stabilization system  \n The precision temperature control system for the PolariX TDS and the XBOC is designed to a achieve a temperature stability of $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m K }$ . Each structure (the TDS for FLASHForward, the two future ones for FLASH2, and the future XBOC) will have a dedicated pumping station to regulate the water temperature with $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { m K }$ accuracy by means of a precision heater closely upstream of the structures. A three-way valve in the return of each water circuit allows the injection of pre-cooled water for removing heat from the structures. The common precooler circuit keeps the water temperature closely below the operating temperatures of the structures. Since the temperature differences between the temperature target values of the specific systems and the temperature supplied by the precooler are kept small, the required accuracy and stability can be achieved.  \n The operation of the prototype at FLASHForward ran smoothly. The stability of operation allowed performing first measurements on an electron beam. The detailed outcome of the campaign of the prototype commissioning with electrons is going to be presented in two separate publications.  \n VII. SUMMARY  \n Based on the recent development of compact high power $X$ -band rf components at CERN, a new TDS design that enables the variable polarisation of the streaking field has been proposed. In contrast to conventional structures the novel device can provide a unique insight into the multidimensional phase space of electron bunches with sub-fs resolution, allowing to retrieve their 3D charge distribution and even their full 6D phase space. In order to develop and produce a modular system for the new Polarizable $X$ -band TDS (PolariX-TDS), a collaboration between DESY, PSI and CERN has been put forth, which will provide several experiments of these institutions with unprecedented diagnostics capabilities.  \n The design of the main rf components and the structure itself profits from the experience gained from linear collider design studies—particularly from CLIC—and from the C-band tuning-free technology recently developed at PSI for the SwissFEL linac. The design parameters have been carefully optimized to fulfill the diagnostics requirements of the four targeted experiments of the collaboration and the system has been devised to be able to accommodate to their different operating conditions.  \n A first prototype of the PolariX-TDS has been successfully produced following the tuning-free technology. The deflection field flatness and the perfect tuning of the freely adjustable polarization of the structure have been confirmed by means of bead-pull measurements performed at the PSI. The measurements corroborate the validity of the novel assembly technology and are in perfect agreement with the rf simulations. The high power performance of the structure has been substantiated at the XBOX2 facility at CERN, reaching peak input powers of $2 6 . 5 \\mathrm { M W }$ for certain polarization angles. The XBOC has been successfully designed and produced at PSI profiting from the experience of the C-band version. The high power test has been limited to a maximum power from the klystron of $1 2 \\mathrm { M W }$ and has not shown any limitations in any case. The prototype will be further conditioned in the ATHOS beam line up to $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { M W }$ .  \n The prototype has been installed and successfully operated for first time in the FLASHForward beam line at DESY. The expected performance of the structure and the other rf components has been validated during the first beam-based commissioning campaigns, from which the first 3D charge density reconstruction as well as the first slice emittance measurement in both the horizontal and the vertical plane have been obtained. The details of these experimental results are currently being summarized in [27].  \n The success of the design, fabrication and prototyping presented in this paper accounts for the further production of the other six structures together with three XBOCs and several movable phase shifters—as initially devised in the context of the PolariX-TDS collaboration.  \n ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \n We thank all the technical groups involved at PSI in the engineering process and realization of this prototype.

In more detail, we report studies of compact and ultra-short X-ray generation via betatron oscillations in plasma channels. For the specific working point examined in this paper, determined by the needs of other experiments ongoing at the facility, at ${ \\sim } 0 . 0 2 \\mathrm { H z }$ operation rate, we have found ${ \\lesssim } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ photons emitted per shot (with a fluctuation of $5 0 \\%$ ) in the soft $x$ -rays, corresponding to a critical energy of ${ \\sim } 0 . 8 \\mathrm { k e V }$ (with a fluctuation of $4 0 \\%$ ). The source will be implemented for experiments in time-domain spectroscopy, e.g., biological specimens, and for other applications oriented to medical physics.  \n Keywords: laser-plasma wakefield acceleration; secondary radiation sources; broadband sources  \n 1. Introduction  \n The expression (laser-)plasma wakefield acceleration refers to schemes of chargedparticle acceleration exploiting the highly electric fields that are sustainable by plasmas [1–12]. Electric fields in plasmas can exceed the so-called wave-breaking limit for a cold nonrelativistic plasma [13,14]:  \n $$\nE _ { w b } \\sim 9 6 \\sqrt { n _ { e } [ 1 0 ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 } ] } \\mathrm { ~ G V / m }\n$$ \n where the electron plasma density is denoted by $n _ { e }$ . The term wave-breaking indicates indeed a breakdown phenomenon, the one involving the fronts of the Langmuir waves [15]. Wave-breaking can be responsible for the onset of regions of high-amplitude electric fields, reaching extraordinary values as high as ${ \\lesssim } T V / \\mathrm { m }$ [16–18]. Langmuir waves, also known as electron plasma waves, are collective oscillations of the electron plasma density. These oscillations can be induced by perturbing the plasma with an external excitation. The external excitation can be realized either through a laser pulse or by means of a bunch of charged particles. In fact, both a laser pulse and a bunch of charged particles can be associated with an electric field $\\vec { E } _ { 0 }$ . This driving field can act on the plasma electrons as a collectivity, generating a Langmuir wave in its wake. In the frequency domain, it is possible to establish a relationship between the pumping field $\\vec { E } _ { 0 }$ and the wakefield $\\vec { E }$ [19]:  \n $$\n\\vec { E } ( \\vec { r } , \\omega ) = \\left( \\frac { 1 } { \\varepsilon ( \\omega , \\vec { E } _ { 0 } ) } - 1 \\right) : \\vec { E } _ { 0 } ( \\vec { r } , \\omega )\n$$ \n where we have introduced the dielectric function of the plasma $\\varepsilon ( \\omega , \\vec { E } _ { 0 } )$ . The explicit dependence of the dielectric function upon the driving field is shown with the aim to remind that a non-linear response of the plasma, when excited by high-intensity drivers, must be expected. This also means that the effective driving field may not be directly provided by the pumping field $\\vec { E } _ { 0 }$ (as for the case of an intense laser pulse) but rather a complicated non-linear function of the same field hidden within the dielectric function. Furthermore, the vectorial dependence is also explicitly shown since the plasma response may be anisotropic. Indeed, we have introduced the double dot product “:” due to the fact that, at high intensity, the polarization of the excited wave can be different from that of the pumping field. The latter is particularly true when a high-intensity transversally polarized laser induces a longitudinal (in the direction of light propagation) plasma perturbation through the so-called ponderomotive force [13]. In the self-injection regime, the laser excites plasma wakefields above the wave-breaking threshold in such a way that electrons from the background plasma, concentrated in the region of wave-breaking, can be injected into the wakefield and accelerated spontaneously. Since $1 / \\varepsilon$ tends to zero for some value of the exciting frequency $\\omega \\sim \\omega _ { p } ,$ where $\\omega _ { p } \\big ( \\vec { E } _ { 0 } \\big )$ is the non-linear plasma frequency, the wakefields are efficiently generated when the spectrum of the effective driver extends over the $\\omega _ { p }$ range. Furthermore, Equation (2) also shows that a resonant plasma excitation $( 1 / \\varepsilon > > { \\dot { 1 } } )$ ） corresponds to a wakefield amplitude that can be orders of magnitude higher than the electric amplitude of the pumping field. In Figure 1, the laser-plasma wakefield (LWFA) accelerator at the CLPU facility (Salamanca, Spain) is shown. The present paper aims to be an overview of the performance of the latter accelerator and of the secondary source of X-rays based on it for a specific working point, i.e., for a particular case of operational conditions. Such conditions were determined by the needs of another experiment ongoing at the facility [20]. Keeping the parameters of the plasma-electron source as they were set for the experiment in [20], the betatron radiation was studied (therefore there was no optimization work on the betatron source but only characterization). The motivation was two-fold: to characterize the background provided by the betatron radiation mechanism to the ongoing experiment, and to individuate the parameters of the betatron source in order to possibly use it in the future as a standalone tool for irradiation and spectroscopy. Experimental data will be reported both concerning the plasma-electron accelerator and the X-ray secondary source. A detailed and correlated analysis of the fluctuations of both the electron and radiation sources will be finally presented, with the goal of explaining the experimental findings by means of scaling laws provided by well-established literature and eventually listing the performance parameters of the betatron source for future use.  \n 2. Fluctuations of the Plasma Source and the Electron Beams  \n In this section, we present a working point of the VEGA2-based electron source. We stress that a single working point is shown, despite many other operational conditions being available at the facility. This one was found to be the most stable for the type of gas nozzle and gas species/density adopted. In more detail, a conical gas jet was used, $5 \\mathrm { m m }$ long at the exit-plane of the nozzle, along the laser propagation axis (see Figure 2 for the schematics of the experimental setup). The gas used for the experiments was pure helium, therefore the mechanism of electron injection was the pure self-injection. Alternative injection mechanisms can be implemented at the facility, and would give different performances of the electron and relative radiation sources. Future experimental campaigns will be devoted to this aspect. Besides the scenario of exploiting and/or mixing different gases, also different nozzle designs with different lengths, different conical apertures and/or capable of sustaining different density regimes may be considered. We do not go further in this vast topic, since the data presented in this paper refer to a single operational configuration, above described. Furthermore, we present a sequence of 10 shots for each data collected in the campaign, in such a way as to observe and quantify the shot-to-shot fluctuations over a significant amount of acquired data corresponding to $1 0 \\mathrm { m i n }$ of operation (indeed, the working rep rate was one shot per minute, dictated by the recovery of the vacuum level after shooting the laser on the gas target).  \n The plasma filament was studied by means of a visible camera, watching the filament from the top, with an angle of $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , detecting the light from the plasma, dominated by the mechanism of Thomson scattering. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3. The maximal plasma density is measured starting from the density of neutrals, which is characterized prior to the experiment on a separate interferometric station. The laser intensity is such to ionize the gas completely before the main pulse arrives on target, in such a way that the core laser energy is transferred into the plasma. The laser beam arrives on the nozzle with a height of ${ \\sim } 2 \\mathrm { m m }$ with respect to it. The ionization rate over one cycle of the laser field is given by the Landau expression for tunneling ionization [21]:  \n $$\nw = 4 \\omega _ { a } u ^ { 5 / 2 } \\frac { E _ { a } } { \\left| E _ { 0 } \\right| } e ^ { - \\frac { 2 E _ { a } } { 3 | E _ { 0 } | } u ^ { 3 / 2 } }\n$$ \n The quantity $u$ takes into account for a hydrogen-like atom different from hydrogen (for which $u \\ : = \\ : 1$ ). Indeed, $u$ is the ratio between the ionization potential of a considered atom/molecule and that of the hydrogen atom/molecule. For $H e$ , considering the second ionization potential, which is larger than the first, we obtain $u = 4$ The atomic frequency is constantly equal to $\\omega _ { a } = 4 . 1 3 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 6 } \\mathrm { r a d / s } ,$ while the atomic field is $E _ { a } = 5 . 1 4 \\mathrm { G V / c m }$ . For an electric field $E _ { 0 } \\sim 2 . 7 \\mathrm { G V / c m } ,$ corresponding to a laser intensity $1 0 ^ { 1 6 } \\mathrm { W / c m } ^ { 2 }$ , within an integration time corresponding to a laser cycle $2 \\pi / \\omega _ { 0 }$ (for VEGA2 $\\omega _ { 0 } = 2 . 3 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { r a d / s }$ ), $\\stackrel { \\smile } { \\int } _ { 0 } ^ { 2 \\pi / \\omega _ { 0 } } d t w \\simeq 1$ , which means that the atom is surely ionized much before interacting wit h the peak of the laser pulse. The peak intensity of VEGA 2 used for the experiments in this paper was $1 0 ^ { 1 9 } \\mathrm { W / c m } ^ { 2 }$ , on average, much larger than $1 0 ^ { 1 6 } \\mathrm { W / c m } ^ { 2 }$ , therefore the front tail of the laser pulse was able to fully ionize the helium gas. The first ionization in fact occurs even more easily than the second, because it corresponds to a lower ionization potential (please notice that the approximation of a hydrogen-like atom cannot hold true for the $H e$ atom, thus the $u$ factor should in that case take into account for the screening effects, but this eventually does not affect the validity of our arguments). The number of photons needed for a single He atom ionization (second ionization) is approximately 35. For a laser beam radius of $\\sigma \\sim 1 5 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ and a propagation length in the plasma of $L \\sim 2 \\ : \\mathrm { m m }$ we obtain that the total number of atoms involved effectively in the interaction is $n _ { a } \\pi \\sigma ^ { 2 } L \\simeq 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } .$ , given a neutral density $\\sim 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 3 }$ Thus, the number of photons lost in ionization is $3 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 2 } \\simeq 1 0 ^ { \\mathrm { i } 4 }$ . The number of photons carried by a laser pulse with peak intensity of $I _ { 0 } \\sim 1 0 ^ { 1 9 } \\mathrm { W / c m } ^ { 2 } .$ , corresponding to a laser energy of ${ \\sim } 3 \\mathrm { J } , 3 0$ fs (FWHM) pulse duration and focal radius $\\sigma \\sim 1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ is of the order of $N _ { 0 } \\sim 1 0 ^ { 1 9 }$ . This demonstrates that ionization is a loss channel for the laser energy with a branching ratio of ${ \\sim } 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ , i.e., most of the laser energy is coupled into the plasma. Knowing the maximal density, we can set a scale on the left plot of Figure 3. This is performed also under another consideration: Thomson scattered light is proportional to the local electron plasma density. Even if it remains true that electrons scattering the laser light are located in a region corresponding to a local plasma density higher than the background plasma density (due to the ponderomotive action of the laser pulse-front that accumulates electrons at the head of the pulse), such density must be proportional to the background plasma density (the amount of charge blown by the laser is proportional to the amount of charge available before such interaction). The visible camera can record scattered light at $\\omega _ { 0 }$ and $2 \\omega _ { 0 . }$ , the latter being produced via non-linear Thomson scattering. The amount of power scattered by the unit volume of plasma is therefore found through (for a linearly polarized laser):  \n $$\n\\frac { d P } { d V } = \\frac { n _ { e } I _ { 0 } \\sigma _ { T } } { 1 + \\frac { a _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } { 2 } } \\left( 1 + \\frac { a _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } { 2 + a _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } } \\right)\n$$ \n where $n _ { e }$ is the electron plasma density seen by the laser pulse, $\\sigma _ { T }$ is the classical Thomson cross-section, while the terms in $a _ { 0 } = e E _ { 0 } / m \\omega _ { 0 } c$ are relativistic corrections ( $\\dot { m }$ is the electron mass, $e$ is the elementary charge and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum). In particular, the second term within brackets is associated with the emission of the second harmonic of the laser frequency. The laser beam is guided by relativistic self-focusing in the plasma channel and its energy is depleted in generating strong plasma perturbations, i.e., the plasma wakefields. In the extremely non-linear regime of interaction $a _ { 0 } > > 1 .$ , the pump depletion length is $L _ { p d } = \\omega _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } c \\tau / \\omega _ { p } ^ { 2 } ,$ with $\\tau$ the laser pulse length. The plasma frequency is related to the electron plasma density as $\\omega _ { p } = \\sqrt { n _ { e } e ^ { 2 } / \\varepsilon _ { 0 } m } ,$ where the vacuum dielectric constant is $\\scriptstyle { \\varepsilon _ { 0 } }$ . In our experiment $L _ { p d } \\simeq 4 . 1 \\mathrm { \\ m m } .$ , which was larger than the average plasma filament length, meaning that the laser was only moderately depleted during the propagation. Moreover, the laser beam envelope oscillations, typical of self-guiding phenomena, could not be properly resolved by the Thomson imaging system. In conclusion, Equation (4) could be used to argue that the amount of light detected locally from the plasma filament was dominated by the electron plasma density more than by the laser beam evolution (unappreciable local intensity changes). In other words, the high-frequency modulations of the scattered light due to laser beam evolution in the filament could not be observed and the low-frequency modulation due to depletion was negligible. The average plasma filament length on the left of Figure 3 was calculated as:  \n $$\nL = \\frac { \\int n _ { e } ( z ) z d z } { \\int n _ { e } ( z ) d z }\n$$ \n where the profiles $n _ { e } ( z )$ are given on the right of Figure 3. The average value of $1 . 7 \\mathrm { m m }$ corresponds to the distance along which the laser pulse is relativistically self-guided in the plasma. Given the above assumptions, the axial profile of the accelerating field could be indirectly measured, as shown in Figure 4. In fact, the formula relating the accelerating field to the electron plasma density and laser intensity is found in the literature [14]:  \n $$\nE = \\frac { m c \\sqrt { a _ { 0 } } \\omega _ { p } } { e }\n$$ \n On the right of Figure 4 the average gradients of acceleration are reported, in the order of $1 . 5 \\mathrm { G V / c m }$ . The axial profiles of such longitudinal plasma wakefields along the plasma “accelerating cavity” (indirectly reconstructed via Equation (6)) are depicted on the left of Figure 4. When the beam was not magnetically deflected for energy characterization, the bunch charge was measured via a beam charge monitor after the plasma source [20]. The mean charge was around ${ \\sim } 3 7 0 \\mathrm { p C } ,$ as shown in Figure 5. The scaling for the bunch charge with the laser peak power $P _ { 0 }$ is also found in the literature in the non-linear regime of laser wakefield acceleration [14]:  \n $$\nQ [ p C ] \\simeq 4 0 0 \\frac { \\lambda _ { 0 } } { 0 . 8 [ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ] } \\sqrt { \\frac { P [ \\mathrm { T W } ] } { 1 0 0 } }\n$$ \n where the laser wavelength is defined as $\\lambda _ { 0 } = 2 \\pi c / \\omega _ { 0 }$ . During the experiment, the laser peak power on target was ${ \\sim } 1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { T W } ,$ therefore we had to expect ${ \\sim } 4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { p C }$ per bunch according to the existing scaling laws. The experimental result was rather in agreement with the expectations. The electron beam profile at the exit of the plasma accelerator is measured by means of a Lanex scintillator screen. The shot-to-shot variation of the mean radial divergence $\\sqrt { < \\theta _ { e x } ^ { 2 } + \\theta _ { e y } ^ { 2 } > }$ (where $\\theta _ { e x }$ is the electron divergence in the horizontal direction, in the same plane of laser propagation and parallel to the polarization direction, and $\\theta _ { e y }$ is the vertical-divergence direction, transverse to the propagation and polarization directions) is reported on the right of Figure 6. A typical electron beam profile is reported on the left of Figure 6. Finally, a typical electron energy spectrum obtained by a magnetic deflector coupled to a Lanex scintillator is depicted on the left of Figure 7. On the right of the same figure the shot-to-shot variations of energy and energy spreads are reported. The magnetic deflector was composed of a $1 0 \\mathrm { c m }$ long magnet, with field amplitude $1 . 2 \\mathrm { T } ,$ coupled to a LANEX scintillator screen $1 5 \\mathrm { c m }$ away from the exit slit of the magnet.  \n  \n 3. Betatron Radiation Sources  \n Plasma wakefield acceleration has also been demonstrated to be a promising platform for producing secondary radiation [22–33]. The compactness of plasma wakefield accelerators is correlated with the shortness of the accelerating buckets so that only very short bunches of particles can be accelerated down to a few femtoseconds [27,28]. This means that the radiation pulses secondarily emitted by these particles will also be short, delivering high peak power. The fact that plasma wakefield accelerators produce for ultra-relativistic electrons also makes possible the emission of intense bursts of light with extremely interesting angular and spectral properties, e.g., the high-energy photon emission within narrow solid angles. Here, we focus on incoherent radiation, which is the case for the radiation emitted in plasma wakefield accelerators by beams undergoing betatron oscillations [22–33]. The radiation field far from the source is found as solution of the Maxwell equations [19]:  \n $$\n\\vec { H } ( \\vec { R } , \\omega ) = \\frac { \\omega } { 4 \\pi c } \\frac { e ^ { i \\frac { \\omega R } { c } } } { R ^ { 2 } } \\vec { R } \\times \\widetilde { \\vec { j } } ( \\vec { k } , \\omega )\n$$ \n where the observation vector is $\\vec { R } = R \\{ \\cos \\varphi \\sin \\theta , \\sin \\varphi \\sin \\theta , \\cos \\theta \\} ,$ with $\\theta$ the polar angle and $\\varphi$ the azimuth. The Fourier–Laplace transform of the current density $\\vec { j } ( \\vec { r } , t ) \\dot { = } q \\delta ( \\vec { r } - \\check { r } _ { e } )$ associated with a single electron, whose motion is described by $\\vec { r } _ { e } = \\vec { r } _ { e } ( t )$ , evaluated in the spatial-frequency/time domain, is:  \n $$\n\\vec { j } ( \\vec { k } , t ) = q \\frac { d \\vec { r } _ { e } } { d t } e ^ { - i \\vec { k } \\cdot \\vec { r } _ { e } }\n$$ \n The trajectory of a generic electron injected in the plasma accelerator is given by [33]:  \n $$\n( \\frac { \\gamma _ { 0 } } { \\gamma ( t ) } ) ^ { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } } x _ { \\beta } \\sin { ( \\omega _ { \\beta } t + \\psi _ { x } + \\varphi _ { 0 } ) } , ( \\frac { \\gamma _ { 0 } } { \\gamma ( t ) } ) ^ { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } } y _ { \\beta } \\sin { ( \\omega _ { \\beta } t + \\psi _ { y } + \\varphi _ { 0 } ) } , \\int _ { 0 } ^ { t } d t c \\sqrt { 1 - \\frac { 1 } { \\gamma ^ { 2 } ( t ) } - \\frac { v _ { x } ^ { 2 } + v _ { y } ^ { 2 } } { c ^ { 2 } } } \\}\n$$ \n where the velocity of the particle is $\\vec { v } _ { e } = \\left\\{ v _ { x } , z _ { y } , v _ { z } \\right\\} = d \\vec { r } _ { e } / d t$ and the transverse coordinates (i.e., the first two components of ${ \\vec { r } } _ { e } ,$ since we have chosen $z$ as beam axis) represent the so-called betatron oscillations occurring at frequency $\\omega _ { \\beta } = \\omega _ { p } / \\sqrt { 2 \\gamma ( t ) }$ . The Lorentz factor of the particle gaining energy from the plasma wakefield is $\\gamma ( t )$ , while $\\gamma _ { 0 }$ is the initial value for the same particle at the injection plane. The phase shift, related to initial injection condition for the electron, is for the two planes:  \n $$\n\\psi _ { x , y } = \\arctan \\left[ \\left( \\frac { \\gamma _ { 0 } } { \\gamma ( t ) } \\right) ^ { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } } \\frac { \\{ x _ { \\beta } , y _ { \\beta } \\} \\omega _ { \\beta } } { c \\theta _ { x , y } } \\right]\n$$ \n where $\\theta _ { x , y } ~ = ~ v _ { x , y } / v _ { z }$ is the injection angle of the electron into the plasma wakefield. With writing $\\{ x _ { \\beta } , y _ { \\beta } \\}$ we mean “either $x _ { \\beta }$ or $y _ { \\beta } ,$ according whether the $x$ or the $y$ direction is considered, respectively”. The phase $\\phi _ { 0 }$ is instead the phase retardation with respect to a reference particle, which accounts for the fact that not all particles are injected at the same time. All the above equations make a self-consistent set to calculate the number of photons $d N$ emitted in the frequency bandwidth $d \\omega ,$ , through the Lienard–Wiecher formula [34] starting from the magnetic field at Equation (8):  \n $$\n\\frac { d N } { d \\omega } = \\frac { q ^ { 2 } \\omega } { 1 6 \\pi ^ { 3 } \\varepsilon _ { 0 } \\hbar c ^ { 3 } } \\int d \\Omega d x _ { \\beta } d y _ { \\beta } d \\theta _ { x } d \\theta _ { y } d \\phi _ { 0 } d \\gamma _ { 0 } \\rho _ { b e a m } \\left| \\frac { \\vec { R } } { R } \\times \\int _ { t + \\frac { \\phi _ { 0 } } { \\omega _ { \\beta } } } ^ { L / c } d t \\vec { v } ( t ) e ^ { i \\omega t - \\vec { k } \\cdot \\vec { r } _ { e } } \\right| ^ { 2 }\n$$ \n where $\\rho _ { b e a m } = \\rho _ { b e a m } ( x _ { \\beta } , y _ { \\beta } , d \\theta _ { x } , d \\theta _ { y } , \\phi _ { 0 } , \\gamma _ { 0 } )$ is the trace space density of the particle beam at the injection plane. The lower limit of the time integral must depend on $\\phi _ { 0 } ,$ since in injection schemes as the self-injection the particles can be continuously injected all through the laser propagation in the plasma, so that they can have very different acceleration lengths (this is source of energy spread at the end of the acceleration process). Despite Equation (12) not being possible to be solved analytically, in general, asymptotic limits can be guessed for particles such that $\\gamma v _ { x , y } / c > > 1$ . In that case, $v _ { x , y } \\exp \\left( i \\bar { \\omega t } - \\vec { k } \\cdot \\vec { r } _ { e } \\right) \\propto K _ { 2 / 3 } ( \\omega / \\omega _ { c } )$ for radiation emitted on axis. The modified Bessel function $K _ { n } ( x )$ of the second kind presents a parameter called critical energy $\\omega _ { c } ,$ determining the shape of the betatron spectrum. For synchrotron radiation, the same parameter divides the spectrum in two regions, each carrying half of the total energy irradiated. Choosing a description of the betatron spectrum as a synchrotron-like spectrum, we expect for high-frequencies $\\mathbf { \\chi } _ { \\left. \\omega \\right. } > \\mathbf { \\chi } _ { } \\omega _ { c , }$ ) that $d N / d \\omega \\propto$ $e ^ { - \\omega / \\bar { \\omega } _ { c } }$ . Figure 8 shows experimental data of measured betatron spectra at VEGA 2. The critical energies reported in the legend $E _ { c } = \\hbar \\omega _ { c }$ have been fitted with the exponential function introduced above. The curves have been represented in order of consecutive shots, where a higher critical energy does not necessarily correspond to a higher number of emitted photons due to the fluctuations of other experimental parameters. The most critical parameter determining instability for critical energy is the electron energy, since critical energy scales non-linearly with it. In the following, we provide the scaling of critical energy upon all the experimental parameters. Experimentally, a shot-to-shot fluctuation of $E _ { c }$ up to $4 0 \\%$ has been observed. An expression for this parameter can be found [28,33]:  \n $$\nE _ { c } = \\frac { 3 } { 2 } \\hbar \\gamma ^ { 3 } ( t ) \\left( \\frac { \\gamma _ { 0 } } { \\gamma ( t ) } \\right) ^ { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } } \\frac { \\{ x _ { \\beta } , y _ { \\beta } \\} \\omega _ { \\beta } ^ { 2 } } { c } \\propto \\gamma ( t ) ^ { \\frac { 7 } { 4 } } n _ { e }\n$$ \n A fluctuation of the mean energy ${ \\sim } 1 0 \\%$ , such as that shown by the data of Figure 7, together with an energy spread of $1 3 \\%$ , is translated already in a critical energy fluctuation of ${ \\sim } 4 0 \\%$ . Adding the measured density fluctuation of $5 \\%$ would not change the result much; therefore, we believe that the main sources of critical energy instability were the energy gain and the energy spread of the electron beam. Moreover, in the above reasoning, we neglected fluctuations of the betatron oscillation amplitudes, which apparently are also less important than the energy/spread fluctuations, since the latter can already explain the observed shot-to-shot variation of the critical energy of the betatron spectrum. The mean critical energy for the shots in Figure 8 was $0 . 7 8 \\mathrm { ~ k e V } .$ We consider a quadratic energy gain, as in [33], and averaging Equation (13) on the acceleration length we can infer an effective value (one for both directions) for the betatron oscillation amplitude equal to ${ \\sim } 0 . 2 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ where in Equation (13) we have replaced $E _ { c }$ with the measured mean value of $0 . 7 8 \\ \\mathrm { k e V }$ as well as replacing $\\gamma ( L / c ) \\simeq 4 6 8$ given the results in Figure 7. Figure 8 also shows a simulation performed using analytical formulas of synchrotron-like betatron radiation, including electron acceleration [33]. The parameters used for the simulation have been: rms betatron oscillation amplitude equal to ${ \\sim } 0 . 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (gaussian beam), electron final Lorentz factor at $z = L = 1 . 7 \\ : \\mathrm { m m }$ equal to 468, and finally the laser and plasma parameters used in the experiment. The effect of the electron energy spectrum and of the radial distribution of the beam has been obtained by summing incoherently the betatron radiation emission from a statistical sample of 10,000 electrons, representing the total charge of $3 7 3 \\ \\mathrm { p C }$ . The simulation is reasonably in agreement with the results, even if the synchrotron-like approximation seems to overestimate the low-energy photons. The mean number of measured photons per shot in the range ${ > } 2 \\mathrm { k e V }$ was ${ \\sim } 4 \\times 1 0 ^ { 5 }$ , with a fluctuation of the $5 0 \\%$ . The detector response (a CCD $x$ -ray camera operated in single photon counting) for lower photon energies was not reliable so it was neglected, due to thermal noise. The used camera was a Great Eyes 1024 256, with an image area of $2 6 . 6 \\mathrm { m m } \\times 6 . 7 \\mathrm { m m } ,$ a pixel size of $2 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m } \\times 2 6 \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ operated at a pixel readout frequency of $5 0 0 \\mathrm { k H z }$ and a temperature of the sensor equal to $- 2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . The algorithm used to retrieve the photon spectrum has been based on the determination of isolated illuminated pixels on the sensor matrix and in the construction of the histogram of their values. This algorithm can lead to a slight underestimation of photons, in general, but this was not the case in our experiment, as no significant contiguous events were detected on the sensor. The process has been implemented after background subtraction and considering only photons above the thermal noise threshold. Moreover, a deconvolution with the transmission function of $2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ thick Al window in front of the sensor (to reflect spurious laser light preventing the sensor damage) has been performed. If simulated within a synchrotron-like approximation, as in shown in Figure 8, the number of measured photons would correspond to $1 \\%$ of the total photon number, which is ${ \\lesssim } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ . The missing photons, constituting the majority of emitted radiation, have not been detected as they fell below $2 k e V$ . The scaling for the total photon number can be expressed as [33]:  \n $$\nN _ { \\beta } = \\left( \\frac { \\gamma _ { 0 } } { \\gamma ( t ) } \\right) ^ { \\frac { 1 } { 4 } } \\frac { 2 \\pi \\alpha Q \\{ x _ { \\beta } , y _ { \\beta } \\} \\omega _ { p } ^ { 2 } L } { 1 8 e c ^ { 2 } } \\propto Q n _ { e } L \\gamma ^ { - \\frac { 1 } { 4 } }\n$$ \n Considering the fluctuations of the quantities upon which the betatron photon number scales, we obtain an overall fluctuation ${ \\sim } 4 5 \\ \\%$ , which explains rather well the observed results (still neglecting the fluctuations on the betatron oscillation amplitudes). Once evaluated for the parameters of our experiment, Equation (14) yields a photon number ${ \\lesssim } 1 0 ^ { 8 }$ for a betatron amplitude ${ \\sim } 0 . 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ which is in agreement with our previous estimation based on a simulation of a synchrotron-like spectrum (see Figure 8).  \n 4. Discussion  \n We would like to stress that our working point at $E _ { c } \\lesssim 1 \\mathrm { k e V }$ is unique in the literature, since most of the previous works and published papers show critical energies on the several to many keVs level. With a more appropriate UV detector, we would have been able to detect ultra-short bursts of ultraviolet radiation, demonstrating a promising radiation source in that range of frequencies. However, our experimental conditions are quite well explained by scaling laws found in the literature, as discussed in the previous section. Concerning the literature, we also would like to recall that with a similar laser system, with a longer off-axis parabola, and similar conditions for plasma density and injection scheme, other authors have demonstrated the same electron energies but higher critical energy (in the few keVs) and number of photons $( \\sim 1 0 ^ { 8 } )$ [26]. In another work, with a similar experimental setup, larger electron energies up to $5 0 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ have been demonstrated and larger critical energies of the betatron spectrum up to $\\lesssim 1 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ [35], but smaller bunch charges. The reason for these differences may be attributed to different conditions for laser guiding and/or different injection schemes realized, e.g., with a mixture of gases, affecting the electron beam emittance, the bunch charge and the energy spread. A similar photon number but higher critical energy has been obtained in [36], obtained with a slightly longer off-axis parabola and higher electron plasma density. In conditions of direct laser–electron interaction, the critical energy may be even shifted towards $\\gamma$ -rays [30,37,38]. With comparable laser intensity but different systems with longer pulses, different regimes have been studied, as the self-modulated regime [39], demonstrating large photon number and critical energies on the tens of keVs. Further enhancing techniques for photon number and critical energy are based on the addition of wiggling sources and/or density tailoring [31,32,40–45] or with different gas targets [46,47].  \n  \n 5. Conclusions  \n We have reported a detailed study on a high-gradient laser-plasma accelerator and its related synchrotron-like source. Diagnostic methods based on Thomson scattering allowed the reconstruction of the accelerating field axial profile and amplitude. Electron and photon numbers, as well as their spectral-angular characteristics, have been measured and explained through the established literature, with particular focus on the fluctuation theory of such observables. For the operational conditions considered here, driven by an ongoing experiment at the facility, with a ${ \\sim } 0 . 0 2 \\ \\mathrm { H z }$ operation rate, we have found ${ \\lesssim } 1 0 ^ { 6 }$ photons emitted per shot (with a fluctuation of $5 0 \\%$ ) in the soft $x$ -ray range, corresponding to a critical energy of ${ \\sim } 0 . 8 \\mathrm { k e V }$ (with a fluctuation of $4 0 \\%$ ). Future developments will be needed for improving and/or expanding the above performances, especially with the aim of extending the range of applications of the betatron radiation source.  \n Author Contributions: Conceptualization, A.C.

The first stage employs RFbased compression (velocity-bunching), which shortens the bunch and imprints an energy chirp on it. The second stage is performed in a non-isochronous dogleg line, where the compression is completed resulting in a final bunch duration below 90 fs (rms). At the same time, the beam arrival timing-jitter with respect to the PC laser has been measured to be lower than 20 fs (rms). The reported results have been validated with numerical simulations.  \n 1. Introduction and motivation  \n The generation of ultra-short electron bunches is strongly driven by a wide range of applications spanning from high intensity radiation sources (e.g. free electron lasers [1] and THz [2]) to novel acceleration concepts (e.g. based on plasma wakefields [3]). Ultra-short bunches cannot be produced directly at low energies from the source due to space-charge forces acting within short distances [4] and scaling as $\\gamma ^ { - 2 }$ , being $\\gamma$ the relativistic Lorentz factor. For this reason and in order to preserve the beam brightness, a low peak current beam is usually generated and then compressed downstream the source [5].  \n In this paper we demonstrate and experimentally prove a hybrid compression scheme implemented at the SPARC_LAB test-facility [6] that simultaneously reduces the bunch duration and its arrival timing-jitter (ATJ) relative to the photo-cathode (PC) laser. A 50 pC electron beam is generated in the RF gun and then injected in the first accelerating section where it is accelerated and longitudinally over-compressed (head and tail reversed) by means of the velocity-bunching (VB) technique [7], acquiring a positive energy chirp. The beam is then sent in a non-isochronous dogleg line acting as a magnetic compressor [8]. The underlying principle of simultaneous bunch and jitter (with respect to the PC laser) compression relies on space-charge effects that, especially for ultra-short beams, strongly affect the longitudinal phase space (LPS), but are mostly ineffective on the bunch centroid dynamics (mean energy and time of arrival). It means that PC laser arrival time and RF accelerating field jitters have a different impact on the time-energy distribution of particles within the bunch (where space-charge must be considered) and on bunch centroids in consecutive shots (not affected by space-charge). By using this hybrid compression scheme we obtained a less than 90 fs (rms) bunch duration and an ATJ relative to the PC laser below 20 fs (rms) downstream the dogleg. It is worth pointing out that standard compression techniques exploit RF-induced energy chirps that lead to a reduction of the beam timing-jitter relative to the RF fields but at the expense of the one relative to the PC laser. Previous works on this topic, obtained in several facilities, reported relative timing-jitters in the range of 50–100 fs [9–11].  \n  \n The proposed method could be of great interest for applications like seeded-FEL [12] and $\\mathbf { x } / \\gamma$ -rays production by Thomson scattering [13] that need electron bunches to be precisely synchronized with a laser system. It represents also a key requirement for experiments foreseeing a fs-level synchronization like novel plasma accelerators employing the combined use of lasers and ultra-short bunches coming from a photoinjector [14, 15]. This scenario, in particular, is the most challenging since it requires relative timing-jitters well below 30 fs.  \n The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reports the implementation of the hybrid scheme at SPARC_LAB. The theoretical background, together with a comprehensive description of the sources of time of arrival jitter, is reported in section 3. Section 4 describes the experiment setup, in particular the photo-injector working point and the dogleg magnetic lattice. A description of the diagnostics tools is presented as well. Finally, in section 5 we show the experimental results consisting in a final bunch duration of 86 fs (rms) with 19 fs (rms) timing-jitter relative to the PC laser. Measurements are validated by means of a comprehensive simulation study.  \n 2. SPARC_LAB test-facility  \n SPARC_LAB [6] (LNF-INFN) is a test-facility providing electron bunches with energies up to $1 7 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ feeding four experimental beamlines (figure 1). It is based on the combination of high brightness beams $( \\approx 1 0 ^ { 1 5 }$ $\\mathrm { A } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } \\mathrm { r a d } ^ { - 2 } ,$ ) from the SPARC photo-injector [16] with high power laser pulses (300TW) from the FLAME facility [17]. The joint presence of these two systems allows the investigation of several plasma acceleration schemes, e.g. self [18] and external-injection [15], laser and beam-driven, and a wide spectrum of interdisciplinary leading-edge research activities based on novel radiation sources, such as free-electron laser (FEL) both in SASE, seeded and exotic schemes [1, 19], $\\mathbf { x }$ -ray sources by means of Thomson scattering [20], high power THz radiation both broadband and narrow-band [21, 22].  \n 2.1. Photo-injector  \n The SPARC photo-injector consists in a S-band 1.6cell BNL/UCLA/SLAC type RF-gun providing $1 2 0 \\mathrm { M V } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ peak electric field on the built-in metallic (Cu) PC. Electrons are extracted by means of UV laser pulses $\\lambda = 2 6 6 \\mathrm { n m }$ ) whose shape and duration (0.1–10 ps FWHM) can be tailored to the needs of the  \n Dogleg quadrupoles VⅡ   \nLinac V   \nquadrupoles Transfer line quadrupoles Measurement   \n1 Dipole stations FEL undulators  \n aforementioned applications [23, 24]. They are accelerated up to $5 . 3 \\mathrm { M e V }$ in the gun [25] and then injected into three S-band sections (called S1, S2 and S3 in the following). S1 is also used as RF-compressor by means of VB [26, 27]. Solenoid coils embedding the first two sections can provide additional magnetic focusing during VB process and control of emittance and envelope oscillations [28]. A diagnostics transfer line, consisting in a spectrometer and a RF-deflector (RFD), allows a complete 6D beam characterization (LPS, projected and slice emittance [29, 30]).  \n 2.2. Dogleg beamline  \n When the photo-injector is not operated in the FEL mode, the beam can be bent by a dipole magnet either by $1 4 ^ { \\circ }$ towards the dogleg or by $2 5 ^ { \\circ }$ towards the plasma acceleration and Thomson scattering beamlines. The dogleg is sketched in figure 2. It consists of three dispersion-matching quadrupoles placed between the two dipoles and five more focusing quadrupoles in the final straight path, that allow to match the dispersion-free beam through the beamline. Downstream the dogleg both the bunch length and the ATJ can be measured with an electro-optic sampling (EOS) system [31]. The bunch length measurement can be cross-checked through auto-correlation of coherent transition radiation (CTR) spectrum in THz range [32].  \n 3. Theoretical background  \n The goal of this study is to combine VB and magnetic compression in a dogleg through a hybrid scheme providing short bunches $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { { t } } } < 1 0 0 \\$ fs) with ultra-low timing-jitter relative to the PC laser system. For this purpose we proceed by fully characterizing the beam dynamics along the photo-injector and the dogleg line with numerical simulations (section 4) and experimental measurements (section 5). The dogleg shown in figure 2 employs three quadrupoles, installed in the dispersive region, in order to zero the horizontal dispersion $D _ { x }$ and its first derivative $D _ { p x }$ (being $p _ { x }$ the horizontal momentum component) after the bent path. Instead, the longitudinal dispersion represented by the $R _ { 5 6 }$ term of the linear transport matrix $\\mathbf { R } ,$ cannot be changed nor zeroed simply changing the quadrupole currents. For instance, it is $R _ { 5 6 } \\approx - 5 \\mathrm { m m }$ for a $1 0 0 \\mathrm { M e V }$ beam. Nontrivial methods are required to properly handle this term, such as an off-energy setup of the dogleg [33] or a beam trajectory variation within the quadrupoles [34]. In the latter case the expected contribution to the $R _ { 5 6 }$ is negligible, being of the order of tens of microns even assuming large (mm-scale) misalignment in the quadrupoles.  \n 3.1. Longitudinal dynamics in a dogleg beamline  \n Being $\\mathbf { X } = [ x , x ^ { \\prime } , y , y ^ { \\prime } , z , \\delta ]$ the six-element vector representing the coordinates of a test particle (with $x , y , z$ the positions, $x ^ { \\prime } , y ^ { \\prime }$ the divergences and $\\delta$ the fractional longitudinal momentum deviation), the transformation of $\\mathbf { X }$ produced by a system of magnetic elements can be represented as a power series expansion of the trace space coordinates. Therefore we can assume  \n $$\n( \\mathbf { X } _ { f } ) _ { i } = R _ { i j } ( \\mathbf { X _ { 0 } } ) _ { j } + T _ { i j k } ( \\mathbf { X _ { 0 } } ) _ { j } ( \\mathbf { X _ { 0 } } ) _ { k } + U _ { i j k l } ( \\mathbf { X _ { 0 } } ) _ { j } ( \\mathbf { X _ { 0 } } ) _ { k } ( \\mathbf { X _ { 0 } } ) _ { l } + \\cdots ,\n$$ \n where $\\mathbf { X _ { 0 } }$ is the initial coordinate and $R _ { i j } , T _ { i j k } , U _ { i j k l }$ are the transport matrices of increasing order. The longitudinal coordinate $z$ of the single particle evolves as  \n $$\nz _ { f } \\approx z _ { 0 } + R _ { 5 6 } \\delta _ { 0 } + T _ { 5 6 6 } \\delta _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\delta _ { 0 } = \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { { E } } } / E _ { 0 }$ and $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { { E } } } = E - E _ { 0 }$ is the energy deviation of the particle from the reference energy $E _ { 0 }$ . In equation (2) higher order effects (mostly due to the $U _ { 5 6 6 6 } \\mathrm { t e r m } ^ { 6 }$ ) have been neglected. The energy deviation of the single particle depends on its longitudinal position with respect to the RF wave during the acceleration process. Therefore $\\delta _ { 0 }$ is a function of $z$  \n $$\n\\delta _ { 0 } ( z _ { 0 } ) = \\delta _ { \\mathrm { u } } + h _ { 1 } z _ { 0 } + h _ { 2 } z _ { 0 } ^ { 2 } + \\cdots ,\n$$ \n where $\\delta _ { \\mathrm { u } }$ denotes the uncorrelated energy offset and $h _ { 1 }$ and $h _ { 2 }$ are the first and second order chirp terms, respectively. Dropping the single particle assumption, equations (2) and (3) can be combined to quantify the expected bunch length $\\sigma _ { z , f }$ at the end of a dispersive beamline [35]  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { z , f } ^ { 2 } = R _ { 5 6 } ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { \\delta _ { \\mathrm { u } } } ^ { 2 } + ( 1 + h _ { 1 } R _ { 5 6 } ) ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { z , i } ^ { 2 } + 3 ( h _ { 2 } R _ { 5 6 } + T _ { 5 6 6 } h _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } ) ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { z , i } ^ { 4 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\sigma _ { \\delta _ { \\mathrm { u } } }$ is the uncorrelated (normalized) energy spread and $\\sigma _ { z , i }$ is the initial bunch length. According to equation (4), the minimum of $\\sigma _ { z , f }$ can be found by canceling the last two terms. This leads to  \n $$\nh _ { 1 } = - \\frac { 1 } { R _ { 5 6 } } ,\n$$ \n $$\nh _ { 2 } = - \\frac { T _ { 5 6 6 } } { R _ { 5 6 } } h _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } = - \\frac { T _ { 5 6 6 } } { R _ { 5 6 } ^ { 3 } }\n$$ \n and the compression results more efficient at high energies $( \\sigma _ { \\delta _ { u } }  0 ) \\mathrm { \\large : }$ ).  \n The previous formulation has to be modified if the beam energy $\\widetilde { E }$ has an offset $\\Delta = ( \\widetilde { E } - E _ { 0 } ) / E _ { 0 }$ with respect to the reference energy $E _ { 0 }$ [33]. In this case, a particle with arbitrary energy $E$ has an energy error $\\begin{array} { r } { \\tilde { \\delta } = ( { E } - \\widetilde { E } ) / \\widetilde { E } } \\end{array}$ relative to the central energy of the beam, and an energy error $\\delta$ relative to the design energy of the beamline. By applying the coordinate transformation $\\delta \\longrightarrow ( \\widetilde { E } / E _ { 0 } ) \\tilde { \\tilde { \\delta } } + \\Delta $ equation (2) modifies as  \n $$\nz _ { f } \\approx z _ { 0 } + \\widetilde { Q _ { 5 } } + \\widetilde { R } _ { 5 6 } \\widetilde { \\delta } + \\widetilde { T } _ { 5 6 6 } \\widetilde { \\delta } ^ { 2 } ,\n$$ \n where $\\widetilde { Q _ { 5 } } = R _ { 5 6 } \\Delta + T _ { 5 6 6 } \\Delta ^ { 2 }$ and the linear and nonlinear transport terms are rewritten as follows:  \n $$\n\\begin{array} { c } { { \\displaystyle \\widetilde { R } _ { 5 6 } = \\frac { \\widetilde { E } } { E _ { 0 } } ( R _ { 5 6 } + 2 T _ { 5 6 6 } \\Delta ) , } } \\\\ { { \\displaystyle \\widetilde { T } _ { 5 6 6 } = \\left( \\frac { \\widetilde { E } } { E _ { 0 } } \\right) ^ { 2 } T _ { 5 6 6 } . } } \\end{array}\n$$ \n Equation (7) represents the effective longitudinal transformation. Therefore, equation (4) has to be modified by replacing the $R _ { 5 6 }$ and $T _ { 5 6 6 }$ terms with the ones in equations (8) and (9).  \n 3.2. Velocity-bunching technique  \n Following equation (5), the bunch compression in a dogleg with $R _ { 5 6 } < 0$ is obtained if the chirp is positive (particles with higher energies on the head) and equal to $\\begin{array} { r } { \\dot { h _ { 1 } } \\approx \\frac { 1 } { \\sigma _ { z } } \\frac { \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { E } } } { E _ { 0 } } = - \\frac { 1 } { R _ { 5 6 } } } \\end{array}$ 1 . This can be fulfilled with a proper choice of energy $( E _ { 0 } )$ , energy spread $( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { E } } )$ and length $( \\sigma _ { z } )$ . Short beams with positive chirp can be obtained with the VB scheme, using S1 as a RF compressor.  \n Starting from the cathode, the bunch is accelerated in the RF-gun where space-charge forces gradually lead to its lengthening, depending on the initial transverse and longitudinal profiles [36]. Figure 3 reports the simulated LPS of a $5 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ beam for several injection phases in S1. Early (late) particles correspond greater (smaller) time values on the horizontal axis. The simulation is performed with general particle tracer (GPT) [37], a PIC code that accounts for space-charge effects. On the cathode we used a laser pulse with longitudinal $( \\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } = 4 5 0$ fs) and transverse $( \\sigma _ { x , y } = 1 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ gaussian profiles. The beam is then accelerated, resulting in a duration $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } \\approx 8 3 0$ fs $( \\sigma _ { z } \\approx 2 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ at the gun exit. In VB the beam is injected in S1 forward-off-crest, i.e.  \n towards negative RF phases. The process is based on a correlated time-velocity chirp in the electron bunch, in such a way that electrons on the tail of the bunch are faster than electrons in the bunch head. This leads to a rotation of the LPS if the injected beam is slower than the phase velocity of the RF wave. So when it is injected at the zero-crossing field phase, it slips back to phases where the field is accelerating, but it is simultaneously chirped and compressed. As showed in figure 3, by moving towards negative phases the chirp is negative up to the maximum compression $( \\phi _ { S 1 } = - 8 8 ^ { \\circ }$ with respect to the maximum energy phase), corresponding to a bunch duration $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } \\approx 5 0$ fs $( \\sigma _ { z } \\approx 1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ ). Then, at even more negative phases (over-compression), it slightly elongates while the chirp becomes positive.  \n 3.3. Time of arrival jitter sources  \n Longitudinal beam dynamics is sensitive to RF field fluctuations in the gun and accelerating sections.  \n Fluctuations in the magnetic field of dispersive elements located along the machine can contribute too [38]. The energy, energy spread and duration of the beam are consequently affected, depending on the photo-injector configuration. The beam time of arrival is also influenced, resulting in an ATJ at the end of the line. We can define the ATJ as the shot-to-shot time of arrival fluctuation of the beam center of mass with respect to a fixed position. The ATJ is produced by several sources, e.g. the changing of the laser arrival time on the PC $( \\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { l a s e r } } )$ , or instabilities in the timing $( \\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { R F } } )$ of the RF system. In our discussion we do not consider fluctuations in the amplitude of RF and magnetic fields. If compared to the other jitter sources described in the following, their contribution to the overall ATJ is negligible7.  \n At SPARC_LAB, the synchronization system operates by distributing a RF signal generated in a $\\mu$ -wave reference master oscillator (RMO) through a coaxial cable star network. The client lock-in is then performed with electronic PLLs, resulting in less than 50 fs (rms) timing-jitter between the RMO and the PC laser system [39]. Downstream the photo-injector, the ATJ arises from three main sources: the PC laser and the two S-band klystrons; the first (K1) feeds the gun, S3 and the RFD while the other (K2) powers S1 and S2. For a given configuration, the beam arrival time variation $\\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { l i n a c } }$ can be expressed as a linear combination  \n $$\n\\Delta t _ { { \\mathrm { l i n a c } } } \\approx \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 3 } c _ { i } \\Delta t _ { i } ,\n$$ \n where $i = 1$ , 2, 3 refer, respectively, to the PC laser, K1 and K2 terms If the dogleg is included, equation (10) becomes  \n $$\n\\Delta t _ { \\mathrm { d o g l e g } } \\approx \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 3 } ( c _ { i } + h _ { 1 , i } R _ { 5 6 } ) \\Delta t _ { i } .\n$$ \n The $h _ { 1 , i }$ terms are related to energy fluctuations  \n $$\n\\frac { \\Delta E _ { 0 } } { E _ { 0 } } \\approx c \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 3 } h _ { 1 , i } \\Delta t _ { i } ,\n$$ \n where $c$ is the speed of light and $E _ { 0 }$ is the bunch energy. If the laser and RF fields are delayed all together by a given value, the beam arrival time is delayed by the same amount while the final energy remains unchanged. Therefore the following conditions apply:  \n $$\n\\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 3 } c _ { i } = 1 \\qquad \\mathrm { a n d } \\qquad \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 3 } h _ { 1 , i } = 0 .\n$$ \n All $\\Delta t _ { i }$ values are measured with respect to the RMO. Since they are mostly uncorrelated, we can write the standard deviations values of equations (10) and (11) as  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { l i n a c } } } ^ { 2 } \\approx \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 3 } c _ { i } ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { i } } ^ { 2 } ,\n$$ \n $$\n\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { d o g l e g } } } ^ { 2 } \\approx \\sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { 3 } ( c _ { i } + h _ { 1 , i } R _ { 5 6 } ) ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { i } } ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n They represent the expected absolute ATJ (with respect to the RMO) at the linac and dogleg exit respectively.   \nTheir evaluation is provided in section 4.  \n Table: Caption: Table 1.

Setup of the experiment  \n In this section the SPARC_LAB photo-injector working point and the dogleg magnetic setup are described. At linac exit, a S-band RFD [40] is used to measure the bunch length. On the dogleg side, the beam longitudinal profile is obtained by means of a Michelson interferometer [41] measuring CTR and an EOS system [31]. These devices are described in section 5. The photo-injector working point is discussed in section 4.1 by means of a GPT start-to-end simulation (including space-charge effects) and a direct comparison with measurements is reported. An estimation of the beam ATJ at linac exit is then provided in section 4.2. Section 4.3 describes the relative ATJ reduction principle by exploiting the off-energy setup of the dogleg beamline. Then, in section 4.4, the dogleg setup is illustrated and validated by means of GPT simulations.  \n 4.1. Setup of the photo-injector  \n The PC laser is configured as reported in table 1. Setting the linac for maximum energy gain (on crest configuration), the bunch has $1 6 4 \\mathrm { M e V }$ energy $9 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ energy spread), 1 ps (rms) duration and 1.1 $\\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (rms) normalized emittance. The beam is then longitudinally compressed with VB and its LPS is manipulated in order to match the dogleg (see 3.1). The final energy $( 8 1 . 2 \\mathrm { M e V } )$ and energy spread $( 0 . 4 \\mathrm { M e V } )$ are obtained by tuning the S2 and S3 phases. With $8 1 . 2 \\mathrm { M e V }$ energy, the dogleg transport matrix terms result $R _ { 5 6 } = - 4 . 5 \\ : \\mathrm { m m }$ and $T _ { 5 6 6 } = - 8 3 . 6 \\mathrm { c m }$ . According to equation (5), such $R _ { 5 6 }$ value requires an $h _ { 1 } = - R _ { 5 6 } ^ { - 1 } \\approx 2 2 2 ~ \\mathrm { m ^ { - 1 } }$ chirp at the dogleg entrance. In order to avoid an excessive emittance growth, the S1 embedded solenoids are turned on, in order to adopt the emittance compensation scheme [28]. The achieved emittance is $1 . 7 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ (rms). The resulting bunch (68 fs, rms) with positive chirp is obtained by moving the S1 injection phase by $- 8 8 ^ { \\circ }$ with respect to its on crest value, i.e. $1 ^ { \\circ }$ beyond the maximum compression (50 fs, rms). All relevant parameters are reported in table 1.  \n Figure 4(a) shows the simulated time-energy distribution. Experimentally the LPS is retrieved by measuring the bunch time and energy profiles with the RFD and a magnetic spectrometer, respectively. By means of three quadrupoles, the resulting beam is then imaged on a screen located $3 \\mathrm { m }$ downstream the spectrometer. The effects of the quadrupoles and the RFD on the simulated beam LPS have been considered in figure 4(b). Its overall shape and inner structure are in good agreement with the measured LPS in figure 4(c). By performing a 2nd order polynomial fit to the simulated data in figure 4(a), we found $h _ { 1 } = 2 0 4 . 1 \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ , $h _ { 2 } = 1 . 5 \\times 1 0 ^ { 7 } { { \\mathrm { m } } ^ { - 2 } }$ and $6 0 \\mathrm { k e V }$ uncorrelated energy spread (see equation (3)). According to equation (4), with such values the  \n Table: Caption: Table 2. ATJ coefficients (equation (15)) from measurements and simulations (reported in brackets).

Measurement of the ATJ at linac exit  \n As previously mentioned, the bunch timing-jitter can be measured either with the RFD or the EOS [9]. In the first case the jitter is relative to the RF reference while in the second one the is relative to the EOS laser system. As pointed out in section 3.3, the total ATJ can be expressed as a linear combination of several jitter sources. For the evaluation of the $c _ { i }$ and $h _ { 1 , i }$ coefficients, a GPT simulation has been performed. Here the PC laser time of arrival is, in turn, delayed or anticipated with respect to the linac RF accelerating phase. Finally, the beam time of arrival and its central energy are recorded on a fixed screen located at the exit of the linac Results are reported in table 2.  \n The simulated coefficients have been cross-checked with experimental measurements obtained by acquiring ten consecutive images on the first Ce:YAG screen located after the main dipole, with RFD turned on. In this case each image contains both the temporal and energy information. The $c _ { 1 } ( h _ { 1 } )$ coefficient is obtained by measuring the beam time of arrival (energy) while varying the PC laser timing on the cathode. Similarly, the $\\boldsymbol { c } _ { 2 , 3 }$ $( h _ { 2 , 3 } )$ coefficients are evaluated, respectively, by changing the RF field phase (i.e. its timing) on the K1 (gun) and K2 (S1) lines. Such coefficients allow to estimate all the jitter sources contained in equation (14). Table 2 highlights two main aspects. First, in the on crest case, the PC laser timing-jitter is compressed by a factor $c _ { 1 } = 0 . 6 6$ in the gun [42], meaning that beam dynamics is mostly determined by the PC laser $\\begin{array} { r } { ( c _ { 1 } > c _ { 2 } > c _ { 3 } , } \\end{array}$ ). Second, in VB the longitudinal compression strongly links the beam to the S1 fields $( c _ { 3 } \\gg c _ { 1 , 2 }$ ) but a correlation between the PC laser and the beam energy still holds $( h _ { 1 , 1 } = - 9 0 )$ . As explained in section 3.3, the SPARC_LAB power system employs two klystrons. If we measure the beam ATJ (downstream the linac) relative to the the RF system (K1 line) with the RFD, equation (14) becomes  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { l i n a c } } } ^ { 2 } \\approx c _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { L } } } ^ { 2 } + ( c _ { 2 } - 1 ) ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K 1 } } } ^ { 2 } + c _ { 3 } ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K 2 } } } ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n From equation (16), we can discriminate the contributions of the various jitter sources. For instance, if the linac is operated in the on crest configuration, the PC laser is the leading jitter source $( \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { L } } } )$ . Therefore the beam time of arrival mainly follows the PC laser timing. On the contrary, in VB regime the beam timing is strongly linked to the RF fields in S1, and its ATJ measured with RFD is actually due to $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K } 2 } }$ . In this case the PC laser timing has a negligible effect.  \n Figure 5 reports the beam time of arrival in the on crest and VB configurations for 40 consecutive shots measured with the RFD by streaking the beam on a $\\mathrm { C e }$ :YAG screen. The emitted light is then imaged on a CCD, where each pixel corresponds to 18 fs. The resulting rms is $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { l i n a c } } } \\approx 3 4$ fs in both cases. According to equation (16) and table 2, this corresponds to a PC laser jitter of $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { L } } } \\approx 4 8$ fs and an RF system jitter of $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K 1 } } } \\approx \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K 2 } } } \\approx 2 2$ fs, compatible with previous measurements [39]. Assuming the PC laser as the reference, equation (16) becomes  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { l i n a c } } } ^ { 2 } \\approx ( c _ { 1 } - 1 ) ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { L } } } ^ { 2 } + c _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K 1 } } } ^ { 2 } + c _ { 3 } ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K 2 } } } ^ { 2 } ,\n$$ \n corresponding to a relative ATJ of $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { l i n a c } } } \\approx 6 0$ fs between the electron beam and the PC laser at linac exit.  \n 4.3. Relative ATJ reduction with the hybrid scheme  \n When a bunch is compressed in a non-isochronous magnetic line, its timing-jitter relative to the RF system (that has the initial energy chirp imprinted on it) is compressed too. On the contrary, the timing-jitter relative to the PC laser increases, since the beam results more linked to the RF system and uncorrelated from the laser time of arrival on the cathode. According to equation (15) we demonstrate that, with a proper correlation between shotto-shot time of arrival and beam central energy, the hybrid scheme is able to manage simultaneously the bunchto-laser jitter reduction and its longitudinal compression. Downstream the dogleg line, measurements have been performed by the EOS system. Since its probe laser is directly split from the PC laser, the ATJ relative to the  \n PC laser is given by  \n $$\n\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { d o p l e g } } } ^ { 2 } \\approx ( c _ { 1 } + h _ { 1 , 1 } R _ { 5 6 } - 1 ) ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { L } } } ^ { 2 } + ( c _ { 2 } + h _ { 1 , 2 } R _ { 5 6 } ) ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K } 1 } } ^ { 2 } + ( c _ { 3 } + h _ { 1 , 3 } R _ { 5 6 } ) ^ { 2 } \\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { K } 2 } } ^ { 2 } .\n$$ \n For the relative ATJ reduction, we exploited the off-energy beam transport through the dogleg (see section 3.1) in order to manipulate the $R _ { 5 6 }$ . By setting the design energy $0 . 1 8 \\mathrm { M e V }$ below the $8 1 . 2 \\mathrm { M e V }$ nominal beam energy $( \\Delta = 2 . 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { - 3 } )$ ), it results $\\widetilde { R } _ { 5 6 } = - 8 . 2 \\ : \\mathrm { m m }$ and $\\widetilde { T } _ { 5 6 6 } = - 8 3 . 9 \\mathrm { c m }$ with a $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } \\approx 9 0$ fs (rms) expected bunch duration at the dogleg exit (see equation (4)). According to equation (18) we foresee a relative ATJ of $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { d o g l e g } } } \\approx 2 6$ fs, about two times lower than $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { l i n a c } } } \\approx 6 0$ fs obtained in section 4.2.  \n Results are reported in figure 6 as a function of the RF field timing-jitter. There is a correlation between the shot-to-shot time of arrival (blue line) and energy (black-dashed line) of the over-compressed beam downstream the linac This means that bunches arriving earlier (later) have higher (lower) energies and they are delayed (anticipated) by the dogleg. The time reference is assumed to be the PC laser, thus a lower slope of the solid lines corresponds to a lower relative jitter. The ATJ reduction from $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { l i n a c } } } \\approx 6 0$ fs down to $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { d o g l e g } } } \\approx 2 5$ fs is confirmed by the model of equation (11) (red line) and the GPT simulations8 (green line).  \n The underlying principle for the simultaneous bunch compression and relative ATJ reduction relies on the differences in dynamics between particles in the same bunch and bunches in different shots. By means of the hybrid scheme we used VB in order to shorten the duration of the low energy $( 5 . 3 \\mathrm { M e V } )$ beam exiting from the gun. In these conditions space-charge forces strongly affect the beam LPS. On the contrary, the time-of-flight and mean energy are not perturbed. To clarify this principle we assumed each bunch centroid as a single particle so that the centroid distribution over consecutive shots can be considered as a unique space-charge-free beam, as showed by red dots in figure 7. The simulated single-shot bunch LPS evolution, including space-charge effects, is highlighted by blue dots. Figure 7(a) shows the beam LPS at the gun exit. As discussed in section 4.2, in this case the time of arrival is mainly linked to the release time from the cathode as reported in figure 7(d). The resulting correlation term is $c _ { 1 } = 1 . 5 8$ $\\dot { \\boldsymbol { c } } _ { 1 } = 0 . 6 6$ , see table 2). Downstream the gun, the beam is longitudinally compressed by VB and strongly linked to the RF field phase-jitter (figure 7(b)). Consequently, at the linac exit its time of arrival showed in figure 7(e) is not linked to the PC laser $( c _ { 1 } \\approx - 0 . 1 4$ , see table 2). At this point, the correlation between the PC laser and the time-of-flight is restored by the dogleg. The different dynamics between the bunch inner structure and its longitudinal centroid allows us to reduce the ATJ relative to the PC laser in the dogleg while preserving its duration (figure 7(c)). Figure 7(f) shows that bunch length is compressed $\\zeta _ { 1 } = 0 . 1 2 )$ while the correlation between the centroids (red dots) and the PC laser is partly recovered ${ \\mathrm { \\Phi } } _ { c _ { 1 } } = 0 . 5 6 { \\mathrm { \\Phi } } _ { , }$ . This result represents a compromise between relative ATJ reduction and maximum achievable bunch compression.  \n  \n 4.4. Setup of the dogleg line  \n As explained in section 4.3, the off-energy setup of the dogleg allows to handle the $R _ { 5 6 }$ term in order to achieve the relative timing-jitter reduction. The dogleg matching is obtained with the MAD-X code [43], by constraining to zero the dispersion and its first derivative downstream the second dogleg dipole. The matching parameters are then imported in GPT in order to perform a full simulation including space-charge. From the resulting LPS, shown in figure 8, we evaluated a final bunch duration of 92 fs (rms), in agreement with the one expected according to equation (4) (90 fs, rms). If we consider that in the on-crest configuration the bunch duration was 1 ps (rms), the corresponding compression factor using the hybrid scheme is $C \\approx 1 1$ .  \n 5. Experimental results  \n This section reports the results obtained with Michelson interferometer and EOS systems. These devices are able to measure the beam longitudinal profile in a multi-shot and single-shot way, respectively. The Michelson interferometer, in particular, is able to achieve a temporal resolution of $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } \\approx 2 0$ fs on the bunch duration, while the EOS is used in order to monitor the beam ATJ with respect to the PC laser.  \n 5.1. Michelson interferometer  \n The Michelson interferometer, schematically shown in figure 9, consists of two highly polished mirrors and a $1 2 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ mylar layer acting as a beam-splitter for the incoming CTR. In our setup CTR is produced by electron bunches crossing an aluminum-coated silicon screen oriented at $4 5 ^ { \\circ }$ with respect to the beam line. Only the backward transition radiation is collected. It is extracted through a diamond window and collimated by a $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ off-axis parabolic mirror towards a flat mirror reflecting the radiation to the interferometer. The light is then split in two beams. One is transmitted towards a fixed mirror while the other is reflected in the direction of a movable one. The beams are then recombined on the beam-splitter and are measured by a pyro-electric detector provided by GentecTM ( $0 . 5 { - } 3 0 \\mathrm { T H z }$ spectral range, $1 4 0 \\mathrm { k V } \\mathrm { W } ^ { - 1 }$ sensitivity). The radiation is collected by the detector at several positions of the movable mirror, producing an interference pattern used to reconstruct the beam temporal profile with a resolution $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } \\approx 2 0$ fs (rms) [44].  \n 5.1.1. Bunch duration measurements  \n Data have been acquired by changing the position of the interferometer movable mirror with $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm m$ steps. At each position, five references and auto-correlation signals are acquired by two pyro-electric detectors and then averaged in order to take into account fluctuations in the beam charge (of the order of $5 \\%$ ). Each point is then used to make the interferogram of figure 10, from which the bunch frequency spectrum is retrieved. In order to reconstruct the bunch temporal profile from the interferogram, the effect of the finite-size of the CTR screen has been considered [45]. It introduces a suppression of the radiated intensity at low-frequencies (i.e. long wavelengths $\\lambda$ ) when the extent of the particle field, which is of the order of $\\gamma \\lambda$ , exceeds the dimension of the screen $\\mathrm { 3 0 \\times 3 0 m m } ,$ ). This is always the case for coherent radiation at THz frequency, and in our case it leads to a suppression of frequency components below $0 . 5 \\mathrm { T H z }$ . To compensate these losses in the CTR spectrum, we introduced a low frequency Gaussian reconstruction. The electron bunch profile $S ( z )$ is then retrieved from the form factor, applying Kramers–Kronig relations [46]. The reconstructed bunch profile is shown in the inset of figure 10. The retrieved duration is $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } = 8 6 \\pm 7$ fs (rms), in good agreement with expectations of section 4.4. The result confirms that the bunch slightly elongated due to the larger $R _ { 5 6 }$ term resulting from the dogleg offenergy setup.  \n 5.2. Electro-optic sampling  \n The EOS is a non-intercepting and single-shot device that allows to monitor the bunch longitudinal profile and time of arrival [47]. At SPARC_LAB we employ a $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ -thick gallium phosphide (GaP) crystal and a Ti:Sa  \n laser $\\lambda = 8 0 0 \\mathrm { n m } .$ , 80 fs rms) as probe, fixing the EOS resolution on the bunch duration to $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } \\approx 9 0$ fs (rms). The EOS input layout is shown in figure 11(a). The probe laser is split directly from the PC laser oscillator and then amplified, resulting in a natural synchronization with the electron beam. This solution allows us to directly measure the relative timing-jitter between the PC laser and the beam, as described in section 4.3. The encoding of the beam longitudinal profile is then obtained with the spatial decoding setup [31], in which the laser crosses the nonlinear crystal at an angle of $3 0 ^ { \\circ }$ . Finally, the laser is imaged on a CCD camera as shown in figure 11(b). Each pixel corresponds to 10 fs.  \n 5.2.1. Bunch duration measurements  \n The EOS station is located downstream the dogleg, $2 \\mathrm { m }$ far from the THz station. The EOS signals are obtained by using the $1 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ -thick GaP crystal, located $4 0 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { { m } }$ far from the traveling electron beam. Figure 12(a) shows a single-shot EOS signal acquired with the CCD camera after background subtraction. The temporal profile is calculated by projecting the acquired images along the vertical axis. The resulting signal is then fitted with a gaussian function, as shown in figure 12(b). The signal shows two negative valleys separated by a central positive peak. This behavior is due to a quarter-wave plate inserted between the EOS crystal and the exit polarizer, whose optical axis is slightly tilted with respect to the input laser polarization, ensuring a better sharpness of the output signal. It results that the laser cumulated a mean phase delay of $4 . 8 ^ { \\circ } \\pm 0 . 4 ^ { \\circ }$ , corresponding to a bunch peak electric field of about $3 . 3 \\mathrm { M V } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ . By averaging all the acquired shots, the resulting mean signal width is $\\sigma _ { \\mathrm { t } } = 9 5 \\pm 5$ fs, in agreement with both GPT simulations (section 4.4) and CTR measurements (section 5.1.1).  \n 5.2.2. Relative ATJ reduction downstream the dogleg  \n Being a single-shot device, the EOS can also be used as a time of arrival monitor measuring the relative ATJ between the electron beam and the probe laser. In figure 13 the time of arrival of 330 consecutive shots is reported. The rms of the resulting distribution is $\\sigma _ { t _ { \\mathrm { d o g l e g } } } = 1 9 \\pm 5$ fs. Since the PC laser is used as the EOS reference, this value exactly represents the relative ATJ. This result confirms the validity of the model discussed in section 4.3, where we foresaw the reduction of the relative ATJ from 60 fs (downstream the linac) to 25 fs (downstream the dogleg). Although this value is slightly larger than the the experimental one, its discrepancy is limited to about $2 0 \\%$ , confirming the validity of our assumptions.  \n 6. Conclusions and future outlook  \n In this paper we discussed the longitudinal dynamics of a $5 0 \\mathrm { p C }$ beam compressed to approximately 90 fs (rms) by means of a hybrid compression scheme. It consists in the combined use of RF VB for the bunch shortening and and magnetic compression for the reduction of the ATJ relative to the PC laser. Measurements on the bunch duration, conducted both at the end of the linac and the dogleg, show that it is possible to take control of the longitudinal beam dynamics while reducing down to 19 fs (rms) the relative ATJ between the electron bunch and the external PC laser system. All the data (simulations and experimental measurements) are summarized in table 3. Results indicate that such ultra-short bunches, combined with fs-level laser-relative jitters, can be implemented in current seeded-FEL facilities. They could be also suitable for future laser-driven plasma accelerators that require the combined use of lasers and particle beams.  \n Table: Caption: Table 3. Summary of the achieved results.

For instance, the $R _ { 5 6 }$ and $T _ { 5 6 6 }$ handling would be more effective by employing more than three quadrupoles and at least two sextupoles in the dispersive path. This would allow to achieve stronger bunch compressions with even lower relative timing-jitters.  \n Acknowledgments  \n This work has been partially supported by the EU Commission in the Seventh Framework Program, Grant Agreement 312453-EuCARD-2 and the Italian Research Minister in the framework of FIRB—Fondo per gli Investimenti della Ricerca di Base, project no.
